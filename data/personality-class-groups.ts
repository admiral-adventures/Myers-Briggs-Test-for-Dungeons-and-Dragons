    description: `Protagonists (ENFJs) feel called to serve a greater purpose in life. Thoughtful and idealistic, these personality types strive to have a positive impact on other people and the world around them. They rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, even when doing so is far from easy.
Protagonists are born leaders, which explains why these personalities can be found among many notable politicians, coaches, and teachers. Their passion and charisma allow them to inspire others not just in their careers but in every arena of their lives, including their relationships. Few things bring Protagonists a deeper sense of joy and fulfillment than guiding friends and loved ones to grow into their best selves.`,

    relationshipStrengths: [
      "RECEPTIVE – Protagonists have strong opinions, but they’re far from closed-minded. They recognize the importance of allowing others to express themselves fully. Even when Protagonists don’t agree with someone, they recognize that person’s right to voice their truth.",
      "RELIABLE – Few things bother Protagonists more than the prospect of letting down a person or cause that they believe in. People with this personality type can be counted on to see their promises and responsibilities through – even when it’s difficult to do so.",
      "PASSIONATE – Protagonists are far from being boring do-gooders. These types brim with interests, and they take great pleasure in pursuing their hobbies – whether that’s hiking, cooking, dancing, growing houseplants, or something else entirely. As a result, they rarely find themselves at a loss for something interesting to do.",
      "ALTRUISTIC – These personalities are known for harboring a deep desire to be a force for positive change. Protagonists genuinely believe that if they bring people together, they can do a world of good.",
      "CHARISMATIC – Determined and inspiring, Protagonists often find their way into leadership roles. Whether they’re captain of their softball team or a leader on the world stage, they rarely lose sight of their main goal: to be of service to others.",

    relationshipWeaknesses: [
      "UNREALISTIC – Many Protagonists put pressure on themselves to right every wrong that they encounter. But no matter how hard these personalities strive, it just isn’t realistic for them to solve all of the world’s problems. If they aren’t careful, they can spread themselves too thin – and be left unable to help anyone.",
      "OVERLY IDEALISTIC – Protagonists tend to have clear ideas about what’s right and what’s wrong. They often think that everyone shares these fundamental principles – or, at least, that everyone should share these principles. So it can come as a genuine shock to Protagonists when people violate their core values, such as truth or justice.",
      "CONDESCENDING – People with this personality type enjoy teaching others, particularly about the causes and beliefs that matter so much to them. But, at times, Protagonists’ attempts to “enlighten” others may come across as patronizing – not the most effective strategy for persuading other people, unfortunately",
      "INTENSE – When it comes to self-improvement, Protagonists are rarely short on energy or determination. But they may not recognize that not everyone shares these qualities. At times, Protagonists may push others to make changes that they aren’t ready for – or simply aren’t interested in making in the first place.",
      "OVERLY EMPATHETIC – Compassion is among this personality type’s greatest strengths. But Protagonists have a tendency to take on other people’s problems as their own – a habit that can leave them emotionally and physically exhausted.",

    successDefinition: `1. LEADING THE WAY -  I am a devoted altruists, ready to face slings and arrows in order to stand up for the people and ideas that I believe in. This strength of conviction bolsters my innate leadership skills, particularly my ability to guide people to work together in service of the greater good.
2. GETTING INVOLVED - I am a genuine, caring person who talks the talk and walks the walk. Nothing makes me happier than motivating other people to do what’s right.  When I care about someone, I want to help solve that person’s problems – sometimes at any cost. The good news is that many people are grateful for my assistance and advice. After all, there’s a reason that these I have a reputation for helping others improve their lives.

    potentialProblemAreas: [
      `With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without "bad", there would be no "good".
Without "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our strengths, but we often curse and ignore our
weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our
strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our
personality type's potential problem areas.
Most of the weaker characteristics found in ENFJs are due to their dominant Extraverted Feeling
overvaluing what they see as objective values in the external world and thereby judging too much by the
needs of others, or by appearances. This is primarily due to the ENFJ having not fully adapted their
Introverted Intuitive function sufficiently for them to be able to discern the vast range of ways in which
they might be being missing the underlying needs within themselves and being misled by such
appearances. The ENFJ naturally looks outward to find value and satisfaction, and whilst it is essential that
this direction be taken to fulfill their primary needs of relation and comfort, without the supportive balance
of a well developed Intuitive function, ENFJs can overvalue the external world to the point where they lose
sight of themselves, becoming fixed in their judgments about people and the world. In such cases, the
ENFJ will tend to live in a rigid - and to others, somewhat surreal - world of definite values which often
seems “overstated” or obsessively connected to other people or human situations.`,
    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Most of the problems described above can be seen as a direct result of a too dominant Extraverted Thinking
function ruling the personality. In most cases this is exactly what is happening, but it is also worth
recognizing that some of the weaknesses in the ENTJ’s personality that are more apparent to other Types,
flow not so much from the excesses of the ENTJ’s dominant function, but from the natural inferiority of
their feeling function and its lack of adaptation. We must also recognize that the level of expression of all
functions in all people is variable and that some of the problems discussed here apply only to strongly
expressing ENTJ’s, where the attitude which flows from using Extraverted Thinking exclusively to guide
them through life creates its own particular problems.
The over dominance of Extraverted Thinking leads to an intensely intellectual way of seeing the world,
where values such as right and wrong, good and bad, useful and useless are judged only by their
applicability to an almost mathematically exact - and to the ENTJ - always rational, attitude to life. Without
the balance provided by other ways of seeing or judging, the ENTJ is unable to account for actions based
upon the inner views or feeling behavior of others, hence such things are always judged negatively, either
as irrelevant - or at best - as being of small consequence. Additionally, with their thinking attitude always
turned outward and totally subject to the world beyond their senses, without the balance of some internally
felt objectivity the ENTJ will often follow their ideas and ambitions without consideration for their own
physical and emotional needs. Indeed, the ENTJ often feels that if only his project, his work, his outer
reality would just fall into line with his own rational views then all would be well within his world and all
his needs would be met. Unfortunately such an attitude can never be satisfied, for the world is not only
rational, but also full of situations and human behavior which must be appreciated and understood by quite
different, and again - to the ENTJ – often seemingly absurd criteria.
A healthy personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an
ENTJ, dominant Extraverted Thinking needs to be well-supported by their auxiliary Introverted Intuitive
function. If Introverted Intuition exists only to support the intellectual rationale created by Extraverted
Thinking, then neither function is being used to its full potential.
Introverted Intuition is the ENTJ’s access to their inner world, to the information that could tell them how
the world is affecting them. Because it is introverted, its images arise from the subjective depths of the
mind, and contain all that the ENTJ has not considered within their strictly rational and object oriented
view of the world. Introverted Intuition provides the personally biased information the ENTJ needs to
balance this world view and protect the ENTJ from being totally swallowed up by their selfless and yet
single minded attachment to facts, figures and a rationale they accept only from the world outside
themselves. Because this inner information is often opposed to the ENTJ’s strongly held ideas it is often
rejected, or if accepted, turned outward to make negative judgments about external situations or the
behavior of others, rather than seen as a corrective balance to the ENTJ’s own attitudes and behavior`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ENTJ needs to recognize the role Intuition plays in their life, and learn to
understand its language. In particular the ENTJ needs to realize that their intuitive function is not directed
outward to the world, that its images are personal, subjective and relate directly to the way the ENTJ’s
inner self is being affected by both the outside world and their own behavior.
Introverted Intuition is not an obvious process to understand, and quite unlike the rational, straightforward
thinking the ENTJ is used to. Nevertheless, if understood and fully utilized to support thinking, it can make
the ENTJ the most outwardly effective and productive of all the personality types. For this reason it is
essential to allow this gift to become what it can be, rather than limiting its talents and allowing it only to
speak when it seems to agree with the ENTJ’s outwardly focused thinking. Below are a few specific
suggestions to help you apply Introverted Intuition.
When confronted by a situation which requires an important decision, try to put it off for long enough to be
able to sit quietly with it. In doing so allow yourself to feel and see the images which arise in your mind
regarding this situation. Try to set aside those which appear immediately as the products of your own
beliefs and thinking, and regard the others closely. If these images and ideas were the opinions of people
whose judgment you trusted implicitly, try to question them in your mind and find the reasons why they
consider things in such a way.
There are some people around you who always seem to know just which way to go or how things work or
what the outcome of a certain situation will be without them seeming to have sufficient information to be
able to do so. These people are intuitive types and their world is full of possibilities which they can
immediately recognize as apt to certain situations. You also have this talent, but you have a habit of not
following it, rather you prefer to think it out and find the options which “ought” to be correct. I placed
ought in quotes for a very good reason here, for you know yourself how often things have developed in the
direction you had an inkling of, but refused to accept without thinking. Try to let these immediate
impressions have their moment and recognize them as true possibilities which ought to be examined more
closely. Understand that they are not baseless images and ideas but rely upon valid sources of information
which you simply screen out of your life by habit.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some ENTJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally associated with a
strongly dogmatic and overly rational approach to life, coupled with an almost total lack of ability to
understand the needs of others. Where such a strongly expressing difficulty arises, the ENTJ finds
themselves constantly embattled by a world which refuses to conform to their ideals and creates situations
in which the ENTJ is out of their depth. Such situations are often met by the ENTJ with such a childish
emotionality that others are put off and isolate the ENTJ emotionally. Such ENTJ’s often find themselves
without friends, and with business partners or employees who are unwilling to engage the ENTJ upon any
matter other than strictly task related questions. Such behavior in others only serves to bring out underlying
sentiments in the ENTJ which, via their badly adapted intuitive function, speak to them of plots, nastiness
and covert obstructive behavior on the part of others. Suffice to say, such suspicions and childish
sentiments coupled with dogmatic demands to conform to the ENTJ’s own way of seeing the world can
soon destroy families and close relationships.
It is incumbent upon the ENTJ to break the circle of such behavior by allowing their Introverted Intuition a
place in their life. Through attention to this function the ENTJ can discover a path to understanding and
recognizing the effects not only their own behavior has upon others, but also the greater possibilities which
lie within themselves for not only a harmonious relationship with others, but also a greater sense of what
might be best for themselves.
Understanding the feeling needs and judgments of others is not an easy task for the ENTJ, but through their
Intuitive function they can find images and ideas which - whilst not speaking directly to the feeling
judgments of others – might allow them to see outside the strictly rational circle of their world view in such
a way as to recognize that there is indeed a different perspective which must be taken account of.`,
    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Give yourself every opportunity to show others your appreciation of a
situation and how you could see it through to a good outcome. Take charge where you can make it
count.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! Understand you have limits too. Your careful world view is not the whole
deal. How things look and feel may not concern you, but they concern many others. Try and allow
such things to be and learn from them.`,
      `Talk Time to Find Out How Others Really Think. You need to drive past your thoughts with
others and let their appreciations of a situation reach you at a deeper level. It will then be possible
for you to take account of their needs as real world objectives which if included in your ideas will
bring greater harmony and quality to life and relationships.`,
      `Take Time Out To Let The Whole Situation Speak To You. Don't dismiss those abstract and
seemingly hard to understand or bothersome aesthetic and feeling judgments coming from others
or from inside yourself. Drop everything for a while, stop thinking and worrying and just relax
into those ideas and let them speak to you. Perhaps they can be accommodated, perhaps
something is hiding in there which offers a new way`,
      `When You Get Upset, You Lose. Your energy and rational understandings are strong assets, but
can be very harmful if they turn against you and leave you with nothing but emotions you cannot
deal with. Remember that others cannot always be expected to fall into your ways of seeing, and
when your drive to make them do so fails you will suffer feelings of resentment and even
abandonment. You cannot deal with the world like this. Moderate your ideas, allow others their
spaces, and you will grow.`,
      `Respect your need for intellectual compatibility. Don't expect yourself to be a \`touchy-feely\` or
\`warm-fuzzy\` person. Realize that your most ardent bonds with others will start with the head,
rather than the heart. Be aware of other's emotional needs, and express your genuine love and
respect for them in terms that are real to YOU. Be yourself.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself. Don't blame the problems in your life on other people. Look
inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than you have.`,
      `Be Humble. Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.`,
      `Take a Positive Approach to Differences in People. Don't distress yourself and others by dwelling
on what seem to be their limitations. They need you to guide them and you need them to see
things through. Try and recognize who can perform the most ably within certain fields outside
your own competence. Let the feelings of others become a strength rather than a hindrance to you.`,

      "CURIOUS – Campaigners can find beauty and fascination in nearly anything. Imaginative and open-minded, these personalities aren’t afraid to venture beyond their comfort zones in search of new ideas, experiences, and adventures.",
      "PERCEPTIVE – To people with this personality type, no one is unimportant – which might explain how they can pick up on even the subtlest shifts in another person’s mood or expression. Because they’re so sensitive to other people’s feelings and needs, Campaigners can make full use of their caring, considerate nature.",
      "ENTHUSIASTIC – When something captures their imagination and inspires them, Campaigners want to share it with anyone who will listen. And they’re just as eager to hear other people’s ideas and opinions – even if those thoughts are wildly different from their own.",
      "EXCELLENT COMMUNICATORS – Campaigners brim with things to say, but they can be caring listeners as well. This gives them a nearly unmatched ability to have positive and enjoyable conversations with all sorts of people – even people who aren’t particularly sociable or agreeable.",
      "FESTIVE – Campaigners may live for deep, meaningful conversations, but they can also be spontaneous and lighthearted. These personalities know how to find fun and joy in the present moment – and few things give them more pleasure than sharing their joy with others.",

Campaigners strive to get along with pretty much everyone, and their circles of acquaintances and friends often stretch far and wide.",

      "PEOPLE PLEASING – Most Campaigners are uncomfortable with the prospect of being disliked. To maintain peace, they may compromise on things that matter to them or allow people to treat them poorly. And when they fail to win someone over, they might lose sleep trying to figure out what to do about it.",
      "UNFOCUSED – The thrill of a new project – especially one that involves collaborating with other people – can bring out the best in Campaigners. But this personality type is known for having ever-evolving interests, meaning that Campaigners may find it challenging to maintain discipline and focus over the long term.",
      'DISORGANIZED – Campaigners’ enthusiasm is legendary, but it doesn’t extend to everything. Specifically, people with this personality type may try to avoid boring, practical matters, such as chores, maintenance, or paperwork. The resulting sense of disorganization can become a major source of stress in their lives.',
      "OVERLY ACCOMODATING – Campaigner personalities feel called to uplift others, and they may find themselves saying yes whenever anyone asks them for guidance or help. But unless they set boundaries, even the most energetic Campaigners can become overcommitted, with too little time and energy to tackle the necessities of their own lives.",
      "OVERLY OPTIMISTIC – Optimism can be among this personality type’s key strengths. But Campaigners’ rosy outlook can lead them to make well-intentioned but naive decisions, such as believing people who haven’t earned their trust. This trait can also make it difficult for Campaigners to accept hard but necessary truths – and to share those truths with others.",
      "RESTLESS – With their positive, upbeat attitude, Campaigners rarely seem upset or dissatisfied on the outside. But their inner idealism can leave them with a nagging feeling that some major areas of their life just aren’t good enough – whether that’s their work, their home life, or their relationships.",

    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the
common ENFP problem of wanting to understand and experience everything at any cost. If the ENFP does
not learn how to discriminate things and people in their external environment, the ENFP will begin to use
their judging function (Introverted Feeling) as solve a “rubber stamper” to support their agenda to seek out
experiences. This is a natural survivalist technique for the ENFP personality. The main driver to the ENFP
personality is Extraverted Intuition, whose purpose is to understand the world as one Big Picture, seeking
connections and meaning in everything. If their ability to seek understanding is threatened, the ENFP shuts
out the threatening force. This is totally natural, but unfortunately the individual who exercises this type of
agenda protection regularly will become more and more unable to apply judgment to anything. When the
unbalanced ENFP does apply judgment, it will generally be skewed to support their subjective agenda.
They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behavior. They will be unable to finish
anything that they start, and generally wander through life from experience to experience.
It’s very common for ENFPs to resist applying judgment until they feel they truly understand a person or
situation. However, part of the understanding process includes using discernment to classify qualities. If
the ENFP shuts judgment off entirely, he or she will not achieve their ultimate goal of understanding; rather
they will jump from experience to experience in a purposeless fashion.
Anger can be a problem for anybody, but may be especially so for ENFPs who have not sufficiently
developed their Introverted Feeling. The desire to keep everything non-judgmental, combined with the
tendency to use Introverted Feeling as justification rather than true judgment is a recipe for suppressed
anger. These are very contradictory forces. “I hate you for judging me” is an ironic feeling, but is
unfortunately common. The inability to apply judgment or to accept negative judgment prevents the ENFP
from expressing negative judgment, and therefore causes them to stew in their anger, rather than deal with
it`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ENFP needs to focus on applying judgment to all of their perceptions. This
means they need to decide how they really feel about people, places and things, rather than allowing their
feelings to hang open indeterminately. The ENFP needs to understand that developing their ability to
discern qualities does not threaten their ability to understand the world, but rather enhances it, and enhances
their personal changes for achieving a measure of success in their lives.
The ENFP concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their motivation for making a
judgment. Are they trying to really determine the objective value or merit of something, or are they trying
to defend their individual right to not be judged or controlled? The goal when judging something is to not
let your personal agenda influence your opinions. Obviously, this is not entirely possible, but it is the
exercise to keep in mind. You want to open your mind to judgment without feeling threatened, and without
using your own judgment in a defensive, rationalizing mode.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `As can be seen from the above, some ENFPs can have difficulty fitting into society. Their problems are
often due top feeling different from others because of their dominant Intuition, and being unable to stick to
anything long enough to feel a sense of accomplishment. They feel like they don’t fit in, and can’t find the
place where they belong in the world. The ENFP who consistently makes decisions and applies
classifications to their ideas will be able to turn their ideas into reality, and experience the feelings of
accomplishment and success that accompany being effective.
The key to personal growth for the ENFP is competent execution of Introverted Feeling. It’s difficult for
most to understand what this means, much less incorporate that directive into your life. I have created
some action-oriented suggestions that will help lead you down the path towards more effective use of the
Introverted Feeling function. Specific suggestions:
When you feel angry or resistant towards someone who you feel is criticizing you, take this as a cue that
you are not judging effectively. When that happens, take a step back from your anger and try to really hear
what the person is saying objectively. Rather than expending mental energy in defining how the other
person is wrong, try to judge what the person is actually saying.
Periodically make lists of goals and accomplishments. Revisit your goals and accomplishments as often as
you’d like to maintain a sense of direction.
Spend time alone regularly for the purpose of thinking through issues in your life.

    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the
common ENTP problem of being so fascinated with their Extroverted Intuitions that they fail to develop a
careful thinking process sufficient to balance it. Leaps of perception, new ideas and strange but fascinating
juxtapositions are wonderful for the potential freshness and possible success they might bring. But if not
carefully appraised and chosen wisely they can also take us far from the right path in life, take us from our
friends, spoil our relationships and even bring personal or financial disaster. Without a well developed
thinking function, the ENTP is always in danger of leaping over social, financial and personal constraints
for the sake of following a new vision. This might be as simple as arousing the wrath of ones partner by
suddenly deciding to by an expensive gadget or change something around the house without being
concerned for their input or feelings, or as complex as allowing an ill considered entrepreneurial idea lead
them into financial and social disaster, simply because the one sided vision of Extroverted Intuition does
not recognize or count the amount of small but important details which need to be right before such ideas
can be realized.
Without a solid thinking function, the ENTP can easily discount or fail to notice the essential ethics of
social and interpersonal relationship, often considering themselves “above” or untouched by such limiting
values and often discounting the possibility that their actions might be or hurtful or seen as unethical by
others. It is not that the one sided ENTP is deliberately hurtful, but simply ignorant of the effects which can
flow from their often compulsive need for change or need to show how clever or individual they are. In the
ENTP, the lack of a well developed Feeling Function means that they must learn to “understand” feeling in
both themselves and others and come to terms with its affects. This understanding can only come from
thinking carefully about the ways feeling affects not only themselves, but others, and the importance others
place on this function. The ENTP has a feeling function more or less global in character and one which
does not judge fine differences. This inability to discriminate feelings can allow the ENTP to say and do
much that leaves others in the cold, so an effort to think about the feeling process can be essential. Without
the understanding this brings, the ENTP can separate themselves from the ground of their life, from the
constancy of their friends and family and, without even realizing it, they can easily find themselves in
untenable positions where, without support, they wonder why they are suddenly alone and lost.
Another significant problem arises where the ENTP has grown within or is locked by circumstances to an
environment which limits their freedom or their ability to utilize their specific abilities. This forces the
ENTP to narrow down their intuitive process to the point where it retains at least some freedom to operate
within their life. Under such conditions however, the intuition is free only to range over a small and limited
field of vision, a field which usually consists only of the very things the ENTP is normally unconcerned
about: the small details of life and its familiar objects. Without the ability to take stock and apply careful
thought to the ways they might expand their horizons, the ENTP in such situations can become morose,
niggardly and obsessed with the most minor or intangible details – to the point where such minutiae fill
their life and each day becomes a frustrating process of eliminating again and again the little problems
which ever seem to stand in the way of the “big” picture – a picture which, as those around them know only
too well, will never be realized.`,
    solutions: "",
    livingHappilyTips: `To grow as an individual, the ENTP needs to focus on carefully analyzing the information they receive via
their Extraverted Intuition. They need to allow themselves sufficient time and space to relax with the ideas
and possibilities they can see. It is all too easy for the ENTP to assume that what they see is what they
need. Careful thinking can allow the ENTP to figure out the best possible ways to proceed out of all the
possibilities that come to them. At the same time, even if they are not able to share them, ENTP’s need at
least to understand the joys and satisfactions that others derive within those situations the ENTP would not
normally choose in life. Awareness of the ways and needs of others can be the key to understanding the
most life affirming way ahead for the ENTP, for there is always a danger that they might choose paths
without regard to the feelings and needs of others close to them. The ENTP learns from analyzing his
experience, so the best way for the ENTP to grow as a person is to develop his thinking capacity. Thus, that
while the desire to run out and do something "new" is an ENTP pattern of need, this need must be
integrated into a whole way of life in which the rest of our human needs and those of others who rely upon
our presence are also satisfied. Your task, as a person interested in personal growth, is to understand
yourself in a truly objective fashion, and how you can best give to the world, rather than just exploit the
possibilities it bring to you.
The ENTP should always pay close attention to why they are acting upon new information. Are they acting
out of a carefully considered motive to realize something truly worthwhile for themselves and others? Are
they really seeking to improve life, or concerned with just making the next play, proving the point, showing
others the moves or climbing the mountain just because it is there to climb, regardless of the consequences?
Living Happily in our World as an ENTP
The problems ENTP’s might have fitting into the world are not usually directly related to friends or
relationships. Rather, the ENTP has trouble maintaining a stable and consistent lifestyle. While this can
affect love relationships, the ENTP usually has such an endearing and capable “way” about them that
others tend to follow their lead, even in the most trying of situations. The problems the ENTP generates in
life are those associated with their constant need for individuality, excellence and new experiences which
test their talents. While this can place great demand upon relationships, tensions are usually only apparent
where the ENTP has made a love match with a person whose security needs are greater than their ability to
allow their ENTP partner the freedom they need. The self aware ENTP must therefore not only be careful
in considering their career choices, but also in choosing a life situation with a partner. Of all the types, the
ENTP is most uncomfortable with compromise and ought not to place themselves in situations which
demand it. Most importantly the ENTP must become aware, through careful analysis of experience, just
what kind of changes for the good or bad have been the direct result of their need for constant refreshment
of life. Only through this awareness will the ENTP be able to focus on those perceptions which promise a
better and more fruitful life.
Most ENTP’s will experience career/life frustration and some relationship difficulties through their lives.
The ENTP with well-developed Introverted Thinking will find these times easier to deal with. Accordingly,
we offer some general suggestions for dealing with these difficulties, as well as some advice that will help
the ENTP develop their Introverted Thinking.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Take time to really listen to the thoughts of others and try to see how they understand the world. Think
about the ways in which your view of the world and your needs can mesh with theirs.
Don't expect others to simply follow you or expect that they should see what you can see as a worthy goal.
A good exercise is to imagine yourself as a blind or severely disabled person. Try to get the feel of what it
would be like to have to organize your life from such a different perspective. Would your goals still be
valid? Would they need re-thinking? Consider the possibility that while your way of thinking leads you to
see other types as having limited vision or ability, the truth is that they are no more limited than yourself,
but simply have a differing focus in life and differing needs.
Realize and accept that for you a satisfying relationship will require you to attend to the small details of life
and show an awareness of your partner’s feelings. You might find this difficult, but it will pay the biggest
dividends in return for your effort.
Expanding your appreciation of the differences between people will expand your understanding of human
expectations. Try to figure out the personality type of people that you know and encounter in your life.
Take care to listen to what people express within different social and work situations. Notice the different
ways they go about their dealings with others or solving their problems. Do not try to compare or judge
their ways against your own, simply try to recognize the many ways it is possible to be at peace in the
world.
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, spend at least half of the time talking about them.
Concentrate on really understanding where the person is coming from with their concerns. Ask questions.
Think of the people who are closest to you. Remember that they have their own passions, satisfactions and
needs. Try to visualize what that person is doing, and narrow down to how they are feeling at this moment;
to one thing they might be thinking about. Don't pass judgment, just consider and reflect on why they might
think or feel in just such a way.`,

    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the
ESFJ’s externally mapped, feeling based view of the world not being successfully coupled to an
appropriate level of Introverted Sensation. Without this internal balance, the ESFJ’s perceptions and ideas
are determined by feeling judgments which are not in always a valid basis for understanding.
ESFJ’s are usually stable, certain, reliable and caring in their approach to life, but if unbalanced they are
likely to treat any point of view other than their own with a kind of amused indifference or a tendency to
keep those with differing attitudes and opinions at a distance. Whilst this is natural survival behavior for the
strongly expressed ESFJ personality, if they do not learn how to deal with the wide range of differing
viewpoints they come into contact with, ESFJ’s can find themselves waging a self created war against all
that opposes their own. This conflict often expresses itself in various unambiguous and simplistic “Us
verses Them” generalities, or a penchant for smugly and narrowly defining other people by arbitrary or
superstitious belief systems, which often actually symbolize and define their own conflict. At its worst, this
conflict with the obstinate and unfeeling contingent realities of the world creates a situation where the ESFJ
retreats to a kind of psychological castle where, not only none but those who have the “right” or “nice”
approach can enter, but also where the ESFJ’s feeling based and often tortured logic, attitudes and
judgments reign supreme and cannot be questioned; a place where: “give and you shall receive” can
ironically twist quickly into: “off with his head!”
The main driver to the ESFJ personality is Extraverted Feeling, whose function is to judge the relative
human value of the ideas, behaviors, situations and objects they perceive. The resulting world view is tidy,
and ordered according to its worth to the ESFJ’s own particular character: “Everything has its place and
everything in its place”. If this picture of the world is threatened by external influences, the ESFJ generally
tries to shut such new information out of their lives. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the
individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the ESFJ who exercises this type of self-protection regularly
will find they can only connect and relate with those who do not actively disturb their increasingly narrow
and rigid world view. They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and will
always find fault with the outside world for problems that they have in their lives. It will be difficult for
them to maintain the flexibility needed for a healthy relationship with the messy world outside because the
differing ways others value things is a constant affront to their personal judgments.
It is not an uncommon tendency for the ESFJ to support their feeling judgments by selectively using only
their immediate perceptions of a situation and how it appears to them. However, if this tendency is given
free reign, the resulting ESFJ personality is too self-centered to be happy or successful. The ESFJ's
auxiliary function of Introverted Sensing must be allowed to grow beyond this limit, where it is used only
to support Extraverted Feeling judgments. If the ESFJ uses Introverted Sensing only to serve this purpose,
then the ESFJ is not using Introversion effectively at all. As a result, the ESFJ does not sufficiently
recognize and understand the vast number of contingent and differing ways in which the world is perceived
by others. They see nothing but their own perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in
order to support their perspective. These individuals usually come across as somewhat illogical and full of
fixed and often rather staid or conventional ideas about the world. Other people are often surprised by the
simplicity, ambiguity and often unrelenting vehemence of their ideas.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ESFJ needs to focus on opening their perspective to include a more accurate
picture of the world and its ways. In order to be in a position in which the ESFJ is able to perceive and
consider data that is foreign to their value system, the ESFJ needs to recognize that their world view is not
threatened by the new information. The ESFJ must consciously tell himself/herself that the judgments of
others are not unrelated to reality; that the ideas of others are also just and valid within a wider and less
rigorous vision of the world.
The ESFJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the way things appear to them.
Do they try to find the basic connections between the elements of a situation? Or, do they appreciate only
those elements which accord them a feeling of worth? At the moment when some connection or
relationship between things is perceived, is the ESFJ only concerned with whether that perception supports
something they value? Or is she/he concerned with becoming truly appraised of how things fit together in
the world? To achieve a better understanding of others and the world in which they live, the ESFJ should
try to put themselves into the minds of others, to locate and recognize how others see things, before making
judgments. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with
their carefully adjudicated system of relative worth, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should
try to see the way others might see situations, without making personal judgments about how others ought
to feel. In general, they should work on exercising their Sensation in a truly introverted sense. In other
words, they should use Sensation to recognize that all parts of a situation are necessary for its functionality
and that valuing one function or objective connection over another narrows their ability to deal with the real
world as it truly is. The ESFJ who can successfully envision the world as a realm of functioning and
connected parts which are all necessary to its balance can be quite a powerful force for positive change.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some ESFJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of an inability
understand the connections and relationships necessary to each situation, a too conventional and dogmatic
set of values which limits the way others can relate to them, or an unrealistic and illogical view of the
world. These issues mostly stem from using Introverted Sensation in a diminished manner: the lack of a
strong internally focused viewpoint allowing an often ambiguous and yet strongly defended set of values to
control the personality. An ESFJ who attempts to envision a more accurate and impartial view of the world
for the sake of understanding the ways of others, rather than quickly deciding how things alone affect them,
will have a clearer, more objective understanding of how society is dependant not only upon adherence to
values and care for others, but also how the world relies upon structure and laws which function regardless
of their human value. He or she will also be more comfortable and less likely to demand that the world and
the behavior of others conform to values of right and wrong, good and bad, worthy and worthless etc. Such
well-adjusted ESFJ’s will fit happily into our society.
Unless you really understand Psychological Type and the nuances of the various personality functions, it's a
difficult task to suddenly start to use Sensation in an unambiguous and totally introverted direction. It's
difficult to even understand what that means, much less to incorporate that directive into your life. With
that in mind, I am providing some specific suggestions that may help you to begin exercising your
Introverted Sensation more fully:
Take care to try and discover how others see things. Try to notice the connections they make between ideas
and objects. Don’t immediately compare your own vision of things to theirs; simply accept that for them
the world fits together in a valid way.
Think of those times and situations in your life when you felt misunderstood or disregarded by others. Now
try to understand how one or two other people would see the situation. Don't try to assume they would
judge as you do: "she would have to feel the same way if that happened to her", or "he would change his
tune if he saw things from my point of view". Rather, try to understand how they would truly see the
situation. Would they analyze it through a code of values, or see it as an opportunity to grasp a wider
perspective in which a solution can be found? Would it affect them personally or would they view it
impartially? Try to determine their point of view without passing judgment or comparing it to your own.
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time to finding out how
the other person sees the world around them. Concentrate on really sensing the relationships within what
they describe. Tell them how you see the world and compare. Ask questions about why things seem so to
them.
Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself "this person has their
own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life than they are with mine." Remember
that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you. It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize what
that person is seeing right now. What connections are they making or enacting, what thoughts are they
having? Don't pass judgment, or compare their situation to your own.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any length of time.`,

Another difficulty, which is not so much a problem for the ESFP but for those around them, particularly if
Introverted Thinking or Intuitive types, is that even when joyful or in the midst of life, they may be
perceived as coldly self absorbed and oblivious to the feelings of others, even when the truth is quite the
reverse. Should it somehow matter, then when in the company of such people, the ESFP should take some
trouble to express their feelings and value judgments.`,
    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the
common ESFP problem of being overly absorbed by the sensations and immediate apparent facts of the
external world. ESFP’s are usually very spontaneous and outgoing people who have little time for analysis
of the complexities behind the world they live in. They are likely to treat any point of view other than their
own rather shortly, waving away in particular the more intellectual and intuitive understandings of others as
irrelevant and totally secondary to the obvious realities of life. If the ESFP does not learn how to deal with
the tension that arises between, what to them is the most obvious and satisfying way to deal with the world
and those deeper intricacies which lie behind its facade, the ESFP will begin to shut out any incoming
information which produces this tension. This is a natural survival technique for the ESFP personality. The
main driver to the ESFP personality is Extraverted Sensation, whose purpose is solely to perceive the
realities of the external world and by which the ESFP orients themselves towards the things they need or
desire. If an ESFP's image of the world is threatened by demands for careful judgment or reasoning, the
ESFP shuts out the demand in order to preserve and honor their world view. This is totally natural, and
works well to protect the individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the ESFP who exercises this type
of self-protection regularly will become not only more and more careless of other people's needs and
perspectives, but also cut off in a world where the facts and realities which they perceive become
interwoven with a belief system which supports only the ESFP’s desire driven view. Under such
circumstances they will justify their own inappropriate behaviors in the most astounding or rationally
simplistic ways, and will always find fault with others for trying to complicate and disturb what ought to be
a simple and obvious way of life. It will be difficult for them to maintain close personal relationships
because they will not only have unreasonable and simplistically concrete expectations, but will be unable to
understand why such expectations cannot be easily met.
It’s not an uncommon tendency for the ESFP to look to their inner world only for feelings that justify their
desires and perceptions. However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting ESFP personality is too
self-centered to be happy or successful. Since the ESFP's dominant function is Extraverted Sensing, they
must balance this with an auxiliary Introverted Feeling function which is sufficiently refined to make
reasonably objective judgments about the value of the ESFP’s actions and the people and things in their
life. The ESFP makes value judgments via Introverted Intuition. This is also the ESFP's primary way of
dealing with their own internal subjective world. If the ESFP uses Introverted Feeling only to serve the
purposes of Extraverted Sensing, then the ESFP is not using Introversion effectively at all. As a result, the
ESFP does sufficiently consider the effects of their actions and perceptions sufficiently for a strong value
system to arise in their personality. They see nothing but the joys, satisfactions and sensations of the world
outside themselves, and deal with feeling only so far as it supports their need for constant stimulation and
gratification. These individuals can often come across as coarse and lustful, although can just as easily
seem the complete opposite, as refined and tasteful connoisseurs who, nevertheless, at closer quarters
reveal their complete indifference to anything but the satisfaction of their own desires.
At this point, I would like the reader to understand that, as with all personality types, serious problems are
usually only encountered by those whose dominant function is unusually strongly expressed against the
other functions. Such situations are rare and although the problems discussed here can indeed be felt to
some level by all ESFP’s, most people regardless of their personality type tend toward a balance within
both their personal and worldly relationships which occurs despite differences in personality preference; a
balance driven by the need for comfort in others and the human capacity for love. So whilst it is essential
for us to fine tune our relationships through knowledge and understanding of our differences and peculiar
needs, it is also good for us to remember that the most simple and childlike longings of the heart can also
be most powerful guides to happiness.
`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ESFP needs to focus on increasing their self understanding to allow a rational
and more objectively reasoned value system to arise within themselves. In order for the ESFP to more
validly judge the value of their desires, actions and the things they allow into their world, the ESFP needs
to know that their world view is not being threatened but qualitatively reinforced by the strength and
objectivity of their judgments. The ESFP must consciously tell himself/herself that a feeling that does not
agree with their desires or perceptions of the world is not an indictment of their character but a clue to
greater understanding.
The ESFP who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their motivation for valuing
certain actions, interests and possessions over others. Do they attend to their feelings to judge such things
according to a strong set of values which accords also with the needs of others? Or, do they judge only to
support a personal desire? At the moment when something is felt, is the ESFP concerned with adjusting
that feeling to fit in with what appears to them as the most important things in the world? Or is she/he
concerned with allowing their feelings to be fully realized? To achieve a better understanding of their
feelings, the ESFP should try to allow feelings their full force, before setting them against their strong
desires. They should be consciously aware of their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with
their immediate sense of appearance, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should try to see
situations from other people's perspectives, without making personal judgments about the situations or the
other people's perspectives. In general, they should work on exercising their Feeling in a truly Introverted
sense. In other words, they should use Feeling to understand how the world of their perceptions affects their
inner life, using it to discover the values that truly matter, rather than simply to support their wishes. The
ESFP who successfully creates a strong value system can be quite a powerful force for positive change.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some ESFP’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of an uncaring
attitude to anything other than the moment, an unawareness of the needs of others, or too simplistic a set of
expectations. All of these issues stem from using Introverted Feeling in a diminished manner. An ESFP
who uses feeling to judge the value of their perceptions and actions, rather than one who uses it only to
support their desires, will have a clearer, more refined appreciation of the world and what it can offer. He
or she will also be more aware of how others may feel, and will have more realistic expectations for others'
behavior within a relationship. Such well-adjusted ESFP’s will fit happily into our society.
Unless you really understand Psychological Type and the nuances of the various personality functions, it's a
difficult task to suddenly start to use Feeling in an Introverted direction. It's difficult to even understand
what that means, much less to incorporate that directive into your life. For the ESFP, the most important
thing is to recognize and understand that Feelings must not be confused with sensations or the emotions
they unleash. Quite often we say “it feels good” when we really mean that the sensation we are
experiencing is good. The sense of “Feeling” from a psychological viewpoint is that it underlies that
rational, judging factor which discriminates rightness or applicability from wrongness or misapplication,
guilt from pride etc. With this in mind, I am providing some specific suggestions that may help you to
begin exercising your Introverted Feeling:
When a new prospect enters your life and stirs your appetite, sit with it for a moment in your mind and
allow yourself to notice whether you have a lurking judgment about it. Try to allow this judgment to come
forward on its own behalf and do not try to rationalize it nor be afraid of it. Imagine that you are hearing
this judgment from the lips of another person, or perhaps from God, anything to let it be felt objectively
within your mind. What is your Feeling function saying about what your exciting new prospect really
means to you?
Think of a situation in your life in which you are sharing your joys and enthusiasms with others, perhaps
entertaining them. Perhaps you are an entertainer. Watch the looks and body language of others as you
speak or perform and notice that not all seem to be offering the same emotional responses to your words or
actions. Each one is feeling you a different way, judging you a different way. Try to notice the same
function within yourself now, the responsive person within you who is also judging your words and
actions. How is he/she reacting to you?
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time to discovering their
values and reasons. Concentrate on really understanding why they feel as they do. Ask questions, and take
some time later to ask those same questions of yourself.
Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself "this person has their
own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life than they are with mine." Remember
that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you. It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize what
that person is doing right now. What are they feeling, what judgments are they possibly making about what
is happening to them? Don't compare their situation to your own; just try to discover how you would feel in
their situation.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any length of time.`,
    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Encourage your natural expressive abilities and hands-on talents. Nourish
your appreciation of the world. Give yourself opportunities to enjoy life to the full.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! Realize and accept that some traits are strengths and some are
weaknesses. Facing and dealing with your weaknesses doesn't mean that you have to change who
you are; it means that you want to be the best you possible. By facing your weaknesses, you are
honoring your true self, rather than attacking yourself.`,
      `Express Your Feelings. Don't let worries build up inside of you. If you are troubled by doubt or
fear, tell those close to you who will listen and offer counsel. Don't make the mistake of “blipping
over it” or “sorting it out” some quick fix way.`,
      `Listen to Everything. Try not to accept everything at face value. Let everything soak in and listen
to your feelings.`,
      `Smile at Criticism. Remember that people will not always agree with you or understand you, even
if they value you greatly. Try to see disagreement and criticism as an opportunity for growth. In
fact, that is exactly what it is.`,
      `Be Aware of Others. Remember that there are 15 other personality types out there who see things
differently than you see them. Try to identify other people's types. Try to understand their
perspectives.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself. Remember that your every word and action affects those around
you, so it is important for you to be fully responsible for your self, and to the values you hold.`,
      `Be Gentle in Your Expectations. You will always be disappointed with others if you expect too
much of them. Being disappointed with another person is the best way to drive them away. Treat
others with the same gentleness that you would like to be treated with.`,
      `Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself by assuming the worst. Remember that a positive attitude
often creates positive situations.`,
      `When in Doubt, Ask Questions! If something seems to be wrong and you can’t put your finger on
it, maybe someone else can. Remember, there are many ways of seeing the world, and perhaps
someone else’s way will reveal the truth.`,

      "DEDICATED – Seeing things to completion borders on an ethical obligation for Executives. Tasks aren’t simply abandoned because they’ve become difficult or boring – people with the Executive personality type take them up when they are the right thing to do, and they will be finished so long as they remain the right thing to do.",
      "STRONG-WILLED – A strong will makes this dedication possible, and Executives don’t give up their beliefs because of simple opposition. Executives defend their ideas and principles relentlessly, and must be proven clearly and conclusively wrong for their stance to budge.",
      "DIRECT AND HONEST – Executives trust facts far more than abstract ideas or opinions. Straightforward statements and information are king, and Executive personalities return the honesty - whether it’s wanted or not.",
      "LOYAL, PATIENT AND RELIABLE – Executives work to exemplify truthfulness and reliability, considering stability and security very important. When Executives say they’ll do something, they keep their word, making them very responsible members of their families, companies and communities.",
      "ENJOY CREATING ORDER – Chaos makes things unpredictable, and unpredictable things can’t be trusted when they are needed most – with this in mind, Executives strive to create order and security in their environments by establishing rules, structures and clear roles.",
      "EXCELLENT ORGANIZERS – This commitment to truth and clear standards makes Executives capable and confident leaders. People with this personality type have no problem distributing tasks and responsibilities to others fairly and objectively, making them excellent administrators.",
     ],
    relationshipWeaknesses: [
      "INFLEXIBLE AND STUBBORN – The problem with being so fixated on what works is that Executives too often dismiss what might work better. Everything is opinion until proven, and Executive personalities are reluctant to trust an opinion long enough for it to have that chance.",
      "UNCOMFORTABLE WITH UNCONVENTIONAL SITUATIONS – Executives are strong adherents to tradition and when suddenly forced to try unvetted solutions, they become uncomfortable and stressed. New ideas suggest that their methods weren’t good enough, and abandoning what has always worked before in favor of something that may yet fail risks their image of reliability.",
      "JUDGMENTAL – Executives have strong convictions about what is right, wrong, and socially acceptable. Executives’ compulsion to create order often extends to all things and everyone, ignoring the possibility that there are two right ways to get things done. Executives do not hesitate to let these “deviants” know what they think, considering it their duty to set things right.",
      "TOO FOCUSED ON SOCIAL STATUS – Executives take pride in the respect of their friends, colleagues and community and while difficult to admit, are very concerned with public opinion. Executives (especially Turbulent ones) can get so caught up in meeting others’ expectations that they fail to address their own needs.",
      "DIFFICULT TO RELAX – This need for respect fosters a need to maintain their dignity, which can make it difficult to cut loose and relax for risk of looking the fool, even in good fun.",
      "DIFFICULTY EXPRESSING EMOTION – This is all evidence of Executives’ greatest weakness: expressing emotions and feeling empathy. People with the Executive personality type get so caught up in the facts and most effective methods that they forget to think of what makes others happy, or of their sensitivity. A detour can be breathtakingly beautiful, a joy for the family, but Executives may only see the consequence of arriving at their destination an hour late, hurting their loved ones by rejecting the notion too harshly.",

    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed to the common problem of
Extraverted Thinking overtaking the ESTJ personality to the point that all other personality functions exist
only to serve Thinking's needs. A healthy and successful personality needs to have a good balance between
its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an ESTJ, dominant Extraverted Thinking needs to be well supported by the auxiliary Introverted Sensing function. If Introverted Sensing exists only to support the
agenda of Extraverted Thinking, then neither function is living up to its potential, and the subject ESTJ is
not reaching their potential in their job or their personal relationships.
In the case where auxiliary Sensing is underused, the ESTJ will live entirely within the boundaries of their
existing principles. They will hold up their own set of principles as an inalienable representation of the
Right Thing To Do, and apply everything they encounter in life to this principle system. If they perceive
behavior that does not fit into their set of principles, they will ruthlessly judge it and shut down any
alternative view of the violation. In being so tied to their Extraverted Thinking process, they lose the ability
to truly consider incoming information, and therefore lose the ability to synergize with other people and
solve problems in an effective way. Perhaps most importantly, the ESTJ loses the ability to connect with
their own Self. They become out of touch with their own personal needs, and dissociated from their core
self. The net effect of these happenings is an ESTJ leader who expects absolute adherence to his or her
demands; who lacks the ability to see long-range implications associated with these demands; who is
unwilling to consider alternate solutions or plans; and who is dissociated from any personal priorities or
value system. Such a leader is unlikely to be effective and successful in their job or personal life, although
are likely unaware of the reasons for their problems.
It is quite common for people to allow their dominant function to overrule their personality. In the case of
the Extraverted Thinker, allowing Thinking to dominate without counter-balance can have great impact on
the social interactions of the ESTJ. Female ESTJ’s may be viewed as overbearing, controlling, or
masculine, and may not be as readily accepted by social standards. This may cause low self- esteem in the
female ESTJ. Male ESTJ’s are somewhat worse off, because social stereotypes may encourage them that
they are entitled to be domineering. They may have no interest in growing beyond their limited outlook.
Extraverted Thinking is a personality function that creates structure by identifying and adhering to logical
principles. It is a social form of judgment, in that it is defined by the external world, rather than by an inner
sense of right and wrong. The true strength of Extraverted Thinking is its highly ethical nature. It is not
swayed by individual appeals -- it believes wholeheartedly in the merit of the Principle. If the Principle
exists, then it should be followed. Once the Extraverted Thinking type has identified the principle, it is their
business to enforce that principle. The Extraverted Thinker does not expect anything back for living by that
principle. It expects that the principle should be respected without condition. In other words, the ESTJ
believes that you should do what's right because it is what's right, rather than doing what's right because
you want something in return. In this ideal sense, Extraverted Thinking judgment is the cornerstone of laws
and legal systems. Extraverted Thinking has much to offer our society, in its purity of intention.
Introverted Sensing, the auxiliary function of the ESTJ, is the means of observing data and storing it for
future reference. Introverted Sensing is capable of considering and storing huge amounts of data. When this
data is fed into the dominant Thinking function, the personality uses real data to form principles and
enforce structure upon the world. In the case where the ESTJ has an overly-dominant Thinking function,
the importance of the auxiliary Sensing function is reduced. Data cannot be seen outside of its context
within a principle. The ESTJ will not be able to see beyond the fact that a principle has been violated. They
will be unable to see the data objectively.`,
    solutions: `An ESTJ who is interested in coming into his or her own potential should consciously try to suspend
judgment until all of the facts are known. An effective ESTJ is not afraid to redefine principles when
information cannot be understood or dealt with effectively within their known systems. Practicing this sort
of behavior will help auxiliary Introverted Sensation to flourish, and thereby allow the entire personality to
become a more effective and positive force.
For example, an ESTJ friend recently told me that he was convinced that his mother's cleaning lady was a
con-artist. I asked him why he thought so, and he said "because she takes money and does absolutely
nothing." Apparently the house was not being cleaned to his standards. He believed that the cleaning lady
was paid to do a certain job, and he expected that it would be completed to a certain standard for a certain
fee. This was his principle. She violated that principle by not doing the job well enough. The fact that she
took money for a job that she didn't do was nothing less than criminal behavior to him. When I asked him if
the cleaning lady had been given directions on what specifically to clean, he said he didn't know, but that
she was a cleaning lady so she should know what to do (another principle.) We soon discovered that the
cleaning lady was paid about half the going rate for her job. When I explored this situation a bit further (out
of concern for my friend's mother) I discovered that the cleaning lady had almost no guidance on what to
clean, but that she was busy the entire time that she hired, and that she was perhaps not the cleanest of
cleaning ladies. When she was given more direction, she performed to a better standard. My assertion that
the cleaning lady kept busy the whole time that she was hired was flatly rejected by my ESTJ friend. He
would not consider that piece of information, nor would he consider the fact that she was paid much less
than the standard rate for cleaning ladies. Within his principle system, she was a con-artist, and he did not
consider data that might offer an alternate explanation.
Rather than simply rejecting the new information that became available, my ESTJ friend could have altered
his principles slightly to allow for differences in personal capabilities and results amongst individuals, and
to allow for the fact that the cleaning lady getting a lower rate of pay did offset the lower quality of service
at some level. Using the new data (made available by Introverted Sensing) to tweak and redefine his
principles would allow him to create a more effective system of principles that would be better able to
handle similar future challenges.
In general, developing Introverted Sensing is the ESTJ's key to optimizing the effectiveness and resiliency
of their principles. It will also improve their general balance of character, and therefore open the door to
growth within other aspects of their psyche.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Be willing to create new principles and change existing principles based on new facts.`,
      `If you become angry, walk away. When you allow anger to control your actions, you lose, and
quite possibly somebody else loses too. After you have dealt with your anger and calmed down,
continue with what you were doing.`,
      `Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you encounter frequently in your life.
Remember that Intuitives sometimes speak in an indirect, wandering way. Try to have patience
with this, and remember that everyone has something to offer.`,
      `Remember that you have the most to learn from those people who are very different from you.
They have something to offer you, no matter how difficult it may be for you to see it at first.`,
    ],
    livingHappilyTips: `Some ESTJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often associated with being
controlling of others, having unreasonable expectations for others' behaviors, failing to consider others'
needs and ideas, and generally coming across too strongly. These issues stem primarily from the common
ESTJ habit of using Extraverted Thinking in a mode in which it quickly and automatically applies existing
principles against the external world, rather than taking the time to weigh their inner data against their
principles for behavior. ESTJ’s need to be able to use their rich store of internal data to feed their
principles. Insisting on adherence to steadfast principles while ignoring factual information is a recipe for
trouble, such as we have seen with various dictatorships throughout history. In order to flourish in a healthy
way, the ESTJ has to recognize the importance of their inner data stores, and needs to use all available data
to form good principles. In order to accomplish this, the ESTJ needs to recognize the importance of
Introversion, and develop the use of their highest introverted function, Introverted Sensing.

      `Feed Your Strengths! You have been given the great ability to create logical, ethical principles that
transcend personal experience. Allow these principles to be as good as they can be by creating
them with consideration for all available data.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! See your weaknesses for what they are, and seek to overcome them.
Especially, resist the tendency to judge too quickly, and remember the importance of considering
other people's feelings.`,
      `Talk Through the Facts or write them down. You need to step through the facts in order to define
good principles to live by. Verbalizing them or putting them down on paper may be a valuable
tool for you.`,
      `Take in Everything. Don't dismiss ideas prematurely because you think you already know the
answer. Seek first to understand, and then to be understood.`,
      `When You Get Angry, You Lose. Your passion for your principles is admirable, but becomes
destructive when you fall into the \`Anger Trap.\` Remember that Anger is destructive to personal
relationships, and can be extremely hurtful to others. Work through your anger before you unleash
it upon others. Disagreements and disappointments can only be handled effectively in a non personal and dispassionate manner.`,
      `Be Yourself in Relationships Don't expect yourself to be a \`touchy-feely\` or \`warm fuzzy\` person.
Realize that your most ardent bonds start with the head, rather than the heart. You expect your
actions to speak for themselves to your loved ones. This may not be enough for some. Be aware of
other's emotional needs, and express your genuine love and respect for them in terms that are real
to YOU. Be yourself.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself. Don't blame the problems in your life on other people. Look
inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than you have.`,
      `Be Humble. Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.`,
      `Resist the Urge to Control Others. You can't force others to adhere to your ways of thinking. You
may think that you know what's best for others, but you really only know how they can best act
according to your ideas of what is right. Just as you are entitled to live as you see fit, so are they.
Instead of judging and controlling others, focus on using your judgment to create better impartial
principles.`,
      `Spend Some Time Alone. Encourage the development of your introverted side. You'll find many
tangible benefits to becoming a better-rounded person.`,

to the objective action of the moment. Many of the difficulties described above flow from this common
ESTP trait of attending only to the world and the people around them for the sake of satisfying their
constant need for fresh experiences and new conquests. For the ESTP who lacks the support of a well
adapted rational, judging function, the objective world remains an endlessly fascinating playground, where
the constantly changing rules of the game often provide the only real codes of conduct they live by.
Without a well developed Introverted Thinking function enabling the ESTP to reflect upon the
consequences of their actions and desires, the feelings and needs of others can seem of little concern to
them. Often, those who cannot match the ESTP round for round are considered persons of little
consequence, or valued only as useful pawns in an endless game of one-upmanship where the gratification
of the ESTP’s needs is the only object. In addition to this, because Feeling is the ESTP’s tertiary function,
its judgments tend to be colored by the unconscious background, which means that it is often used
negatively. In responding to the ESTP’s sense driven thinking assessments, such a feeling function plays
down empathy and enhances the maintenance of negative feelings about others, particularly when they do
not “go along” with the ESTP’s primary function driven ways and needs.
Under such conditions the strongly expressing ESTP, whose auxiliary Introverted Thinking function serves
only to make biased, supportive, “correct” judgments about their own behavior, will often “stand outside
the circle”, their biased judgments reducing others to a mere audience, expected to support the ESTP’s
notions without question. In relationships this can be a danger, for it means the ESTP will rarely accede to
the feeling based demands of others, nor give credit to those ideas which arise from an intuitive outlook on
life. Their behavior in this regard often borders on outright contempt or a sullen refusal to accept anything
outside their own purview.
Such strongly expressing ESTP’s can sometimes find themselves without any truly close relationships, for
their behavior often provides a strong signal to others, who sense that “here be dragons”, and consequently
offer as little as possible of their personal feelings or worldly knowledge as grist to the ESTP’s one upmanship mill. Under these circumstances, whilst the ESTP may have lots of acquaintances and partners
in fun, there will be very few who will befriend them at any truly supportive, emotional level.
Apart from the reasons given above, some narrowly expressing ESTP’s can sometimes find themselves
isolated because of the unusual things they believe about people and the world - particularly in regard to the
reasons they believe certain things happen. The ESTP is extremely familiar with the workings of the
immediate, rational world of the senses, but because their Intuition is a virtually unconscious function, their
ideas about things outside their ken can quite often be extraordinarily quaint, superstitious or just downright
bizarre, and their thinking can weave some amazing logic to support these beliefs. This rarely affects their
day to day life, for these ideas and superstitions quite often support their keenness and abilities, but in a
situation where truly intuitive or theoretical notions are considered relevant and important, the ESTP can
find themselves very much the odd man out.
Of all the personality types, the strongly expressing ESTP can be the hardest to convince that their world
view is not the only valid one; that it does not necessarily spring from the best and only way to be; that
everyone else in the world that is “normal” does not approach life in the same way as the ESTP.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ESTP needs to focus on freeing their thinking from the control of Extraverted
Sensing and allow them the space to make careful, rational judgments. Not only about the immediate,
external situation, but also about the ways in which it can be managed to create a more valuable, long term
result. The ESTP’s capacity to do this is innate; it hides just beneath the surface and takes only a few
deliberate moments to allow it to work. All the ESTP needs to do is to recognize the difference between
thinking with the moment, with the subject of their immediate sense impressions, and the thinking they do
when nothing else grasps their attention. The ESTP needs to recognize that the second kind of thinking, this
“alone with self” space, is full of potential for careful judgment of their actions and consideration of the
best course for the future. Introverted Thinking is in truth the ESTP secret weapon. It is Introverted
Thinking working in the background of their life which makes the ESTP such a potent personality.
Bringing it into the foreground, allowing its power to be no longer a secret to them is the key to ESTP
development.
I want to offer the ESTP some specific suggestions and advice here, for bringing the value of introspection
into focus it isn’t just a matter of flipping a switch in the head. One of the reasons for this is that, when
uncoupled from the fascinations of the outer world and reality, the ESTP’s Introverted Thinking tends to
get caught up in the negative judgments and images which flow from their feeling and intuitive functions;
all too easily falling into a cloudy, uncertain world of anxieties and sinister implications. The ESTP’s inner
space needs to be cleared of this often childish and ill-informed miasma of negativity. So it is necessary to
reassure yourself, to calmly and decisively insist upon quiet in your inner mind, and have faith that all
concerns will be taken care of by the “adult of the household” (the mature version of Introverted Thinking.)
Turning off the world and getting into your own space can be difficult at the beginning, but it provides the
greatest rewards. For the ESTP doesn’t need to learn how to think, they already do it extremely well – they
just need to turn their thinking upon themselves. They need to measure and evaluate their usefulness, their
actions, their relationships in ways that look for quality, and in ways to offer value to all things and people
in their lives.
Challenge yourself. Challenges are simple stuff for the ESTP, and all it really takes is a few moments of
reflection each day. Ask yourself regularly: “What am I doing? Why am I doing it? Who benefits from it?”
Ask these questions in every type of situation, and discover how the answers begin showing a path toward
not only greater understanding of self and others, but also show ways to include others in a relationship
with your whole self. Soon you will discover your feelings and intuitions coming on board with a more
positive and inclusive force. Growing yourself soon becomes easy, because it just takes the simple routine
of letting your innate power of considered thought work upon your own life, rather than only using it to
support what’s going on outside. Think about it. `,
    livingHappilyTips: `ESTP’s usually have a strong group of supporters, both at work and socially. They are often popular, their
appeal is magnetic and they attract those who would like to do the things they can do. The problems the
ESTP has fitting into the world tend to be related to the flip side of this attractive and challenging exterior,
for the deeper and more intimate side of people tends to avoid them, just as the ESTP tends to avoid the
deeper connections. ESTP’s have no trouble attracting lovers and admirers, they simply have trouble
keeping them, for once relationships begin to demand constancy and deep, feeling based connections, the
ESTP is often left wondering what the fuss was about. Their inadequacy in this regard can often make
others feel they are lacking any real feelings or desire for commitment, whilst the truth is that they simply
do not know the path to such things without a long and difficult learning period. They are more frightened
of feelings rather than unable to feel, they are more timid of commitment rather than unable to commit. In
relationships the ESTP needs reassurance, but all too often their needs are unspoken and interpreted as
inabilities.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Ask yourself what you want from a long term relationship. Now turn this around and see how your
requirements compare with others. Are you being realistic? Have you forgotten to include the needs of
others in your ideal relationship? Are you afraid of the things you need to offer, or are you just afraid that
in offering them you will lose something?
Always remember, that a relationship which adds to your personal skills and life is a valuable one, while a
relationship which limits your ability to be yourself is not going to work. Now try to see how your own
demands and needs might add to another, and what they might take away from them.
Don’t be afraid of letting your feelings show, even if they frighten you for their weakness or showing your
own vulnerability. More often than not, such honesty is the beginning of the kind of relationship that can
lead you to grow.
Your best partner is going to be the one who fills your private space, your thinking space, as well as your
senses. Try to talk to others about what you think. Discover yourself in your thoughts and let relationships
grow through your letting the other person into your inner world. Discuss your fears and limits and
discover the strength available to you from the support of another who may have what you need.`,
    ],
    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Give yourself every opportunity to show your innate skills. If you are not in
a relationship or a job which allows this to happen, it might be time to discover ways to change
this. Remember, your strengths derive from being able to deal with the world, with situations
where getting things done, where opportunities to surmount difficulty exist.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses. Try to be straight up with yourself. You have limitations others find as
strengths. So what? You don’t have to hide behind a curtain of fear just because you have
difficulty with feelings or sorting out your inner perceptions. Allow yourself to be who you are
and at the same time let others help you be more honest with your limitations.`,
      `Talk About Your Thoughts. Discussing your ideas and perceptions with others will help you to
develop your separate, inner reality, make you a “real” person to them even without all that
external activity. How well you use your auxiliary function is very important to your overall
health and happiness.`,
      `Don't Be Afraid to Show Emotion. Your inferior functions want you to be still a child inside, and
that makes you run, that makes you want to prove yourself even more. You don’t have to prove
anything to anyone in this regard. Everyone feel emotion and everyone is a little child inside. Find
those people whose eyes tell you that you are not alone, and let them hear your child’s voice.`,
      `Respect Your Need for Action. Understand that you need to be actively working with your
environment to be \`in the groove\` with life. Don't chastise yourself for not being the sort to sit
around and read a book or watch a movie. Choose a partner and companions who value active
lifestyles, but remember to allow yourself time out to consider how their input into your life will
change it. Don’t just follow your nose – life is not an endless party or expedition.`,
      `Recognize the Differences in Others. Realize that everyone is different, not just a little different,
but very different. Everyone has their place and value. You need to notice those values and places,
places where you cannot easily fit. You can learn from these people, for they have gifts you can
use, gifts they offer simply by being who they are. Try figuring out their psychological type for
yourself and notice how certain types can lift you out of negative feelings just by being who they
are`,
      `It's OK to Get Out of your Comfort Zone. Understand that the only way to grow is to get outside
of your comfort zone. If you're uncomfortable with an idea or situation because you're not sure
how to act, that's good! That's an opportunity for growth.`,
      `Identify and Express Your Feelings. You may have a hard time figuring out exactly how you feel
about someone that you're involved with. It's important that you do figure this out. Don't lead
someone on with your ambivalence. If you determine that you value the person, tell them so every
time you think of it. This is the best way to make them feel secure in your affections, and so to
promote a long-lasting relationship.`,
      `Be Aware that You can Fail, and that it is OK. Not every mountain can be climbed, not every
customer will be satisfied, no matter how hard you try or no matter what tricks you bring to bear.
Getting beaten is an opportunity to reflect upon what is important, what really matters in life. Next
time you will take up a challenge more worthy of your skills, and more valuable to others. You
can be a champion, and it will be at your own game. Try to let it be a game of life, where
everyone wins if you do.`,
      `Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself with fear and dark imaginings. Expect the best, and the
best will come.`,

    explanationOfProblems: `Most of the problems described above are a result of Introverted iNtuition overtaking the INFJ's personality
to the point that all of the other functions become slaves to Introverted iNtuition. A healthy personality
needs to have a good balance between its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an INFJ, the dominant
Introverted iNtuition needs to be well-supported by the auxiliary Extraverted Feeling function. If
Extraverted Feeling exists only to support the desires of Introverted iNtuition, then neither function is being
used to its potential.
Introverted iNtuition is a personality function that constantly gathers information, and sees everything from
many different perspectives. As the dominant player in a personality, it has the effect of constantly
bombarding the psyche with new information to consider. Introverted iNtuition is sort of like a framework
for understanding that exists in the mind. As something is perceived, it is melded into the existing intuitive
framework. If an entirely new piece of information is perceived by the Introverted iNtuitive, that person
must redefine their entire framework of reference. So, Introverted iNtuitives are constantly taking in
information about the world that needs to be processed in a relatively lengthy manner in order to be
understood. That presents quite a challenge to the INFJ. It's not unusual for an INFJ to feel overwhelmed
with all of the things that he or she needs to consider in order to fully understand an idea or situation.
When Introverted iNtuition dominates the INFJ such that the other functions cannot serve their own
purposes, we find the INFJ cutting off information that it needs to consider. If the psyche is presented with
information that looks anything like something that Introverted iNtuition has processed in the past, it uses
Extraverted Feeling to quickly reject that information. The psyche uses Extraverted Feeling to reject the
ideas, rather than taking the information into its intuitive framework, and therefore potentially causing that
framework to be reshaped and redefined.
Using Extraverted Feeling in this manner may effectively serve the immediate needs of Introverted
iNtuition, but it is not ideal. It causes the INFJ to not consider information that may be useful or critical in
developing a real understanding of an issue. It may cause the INFJ to come off as too strongly opinionated
or snobbish to others.
The better use of Extraverted Feeling for an INFJ would be to use it to assess the INFJ's rich insights and
weigh them against the external world. When the INFJ personality uses Extraverted Feeling to cut off
incoming information, rather than to judge internal intuitions, it is effectively cheating itself. It's like
getting the answers to a test without having to really understand the questions. It's easier to get the answer
right away, rather than to have to figure everything out. For the INFJ, who has a tremendous amount of
information and "studying" that needs to be done, it's very tempting to take shortcuts. Most INFJ’s will do
this to some extent. The real problems occur when an INFJ personality has become so imbalanced that its
owner is extremely self-important and rarely consider anyone else's opinions or ideas.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the INFJ needs to focus on applying their judgment to things only after they have
gone through their intuition. In other words, the INFJ needs to consciously try not to use their judgment to
dismiss ideas prematurely. Rather, they should use their judgment against their own ideas. One cannot
effectively judge something that they don't understand. The INFJ needs to take things entirely into their
intuition in order to understand them. It may be necessary to give your intuition enough time to work
through the new information so that it can rebuild its global framework of understanding. INFJ’s need to
focus on using their judgment not to dismiss ideas, but rather to support their intuitive framework.
An INFJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the subject of their judgments,
and their motivation for making judgments. Are they judging something external to themselves, or are they
judging something that they have sifted through their intuition? Is the motivation for judging something to
be able to understand its usefulness in the world, or to dismiss it? Too often, an INFJ will judge something
without properly understanding it, and with the intention of dismissing it. Seek first to understand, then to
judge.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some INFJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally associated with not
knowing (or caring) how they come across to others, and with having unreasonable expectations for others'
behaviors. Both of these issues stem from using Extraverted Feeling primarily to dismiss external ideas,
rather than to sort through their own intuitions.
An INFJ who uses Extraverted Feeling in this diminished manner may become so strongly opinionated that
they form rigid and unreasonable expectations for others. They may feel so strongly about things that they
become very passionate and agitated when they feel that something has gone wrong. In these cases, it's not
uncommon for the INFJ to express their displeasure with biting sarcasm. They become so emotionally
upset that they are generally not aware of how their behavior comes across to others. Even if the
consequences of their attitude and behavior are pointed out to them, they may be agitated to the point that
they don't care. This kind of situation can be devastating to the INFJ on many levels, and should be
avoided. There isn't much that can be done once the INFJ has reached the point where they are too upset to
care about others, but the INFJ can prevent this problem from occurring by ensuring that they never get to
that point.
How can you, as an INFJ, ensure that you won't get that upset? It probably seems to you that these kinds of
upsets are caused by external circumstances and situations. Well, that's not really true. It's true that things
will happen over which you have no control. But you certainly have control over how you perceive these
things, or more appropriately, how you *judge* these things.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Take care to listen to someone's idea entirely before you pass judgment on it. Ask questions if necessary.
Do whatever it takes to make sure that you understand the idea. Try not to begin judging anything about the
idea until you have understood it entirely.
Before you begin talking to another person, pause for a moment and look at that person. Take in that
person's attitude and feelings at that moment. Be aware of the person with whom you're speaking.
If you become upset, walk away immediately. DO NOT express anger. When you get angry, you lose.
After you have calmed down, apologize for leaving and continue with what you were doing.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you encounter frequently in your life. Remember that
people with the Sensing preference need to be communicated with in a direct, concise manner. Speak
plainly and simply with Sensors, giving "yes" or "no" answers.
Try to be on good terms with all people, even those that you consider beneath you. Try to understand that
everybody has something to offer`,

      "UNREALISTIC – Nothing in this world is perfect – and that can be a difficult truth for Mediators to accept. People with this personality type can be hopeless romantics, with rose-colored visions of what their lives should be like. This can set Mediators up for disappointment when reality inevitably falls short of their dreams.",
      "SELF-ISOLATING – Mediators long to connect with others, but they don’t always know how. Especially in new environments, Mediators may be reluctant to put themselves out there in ways that would help them make new friends or become involved in a new community. As a result, people with this personality type may sometimes feel lonely or isolated.",

    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various
degrees to the common INFP problem of only taking in data that justifies their personal
opinions. INFP’s are usually very intense and sensitive people, and feel seriously
threatened by criticism. They are likely to treat any point of view other than their own as
criticism of their own perspective. If the INFP does not learn how to deal with this
perceived criticism, the INFP will begin to shut out the incoming information that causes
them pain. This is a natural survivalist technique for the INFP personality. The main
driver to the INFP personality is Introverted Feeling, whose purpose is to maintain and
honor an intensely personal system of values and morals. If an INFP's personal value
system is threatened by external influences, the INFP shuts out the threatening data in
order to preserve and honor their value system. This is totally natural, and works well to
protect the individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the INFP who exercises this
type of self-protection regularly will become more and more unaware of other people's
perspectives, and thus more and more isolated from a real understanding of the world that
they live in. They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and
will always find fault with the external world for problems that they have in their lives. It
will be difficult for them to maintain close personal relationships because they will have
unreasonable expectations, and will be unable to accept blame.
It’s not an uncommon tendency for the INFP to look to the external world primarily for
information that will support their ideas and values. However, if this tendency is given
free reign, the resulting INFP personality is too self-centered to be happy or successful.
Since the INFP's dominant function to their personality is Introverted Feeling, they must
balance this with an auxiliary Extraverted iNtuitive function. The INFP takes in
information via Extraverted iNtuition. This is also the INFP's primary way of dealing
with the external world. If the INFP uses Extraverted iNtuition only to serve the purposes
of Introverted Feeling, then the INFP is not using Extraversion effectively at all. As a
result, the INFP does not take in enough information about the external world to have a
good sense of what's going on. They see nothing but their own perspective, and deal with
the world only so far as they need to in order to support their perspective. These
individuals usually come across as selfish and unrealistic. Depending on how serious the
problem is, they may appear to be anything from "a bit eccentric" to "way out there".
Many times other people are unable to understand or relate to these people.
`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the INFP needs to focus on opening their perspective to include
a more accurate picture of what is really going on in the world. In order to be in a
position in which the INFP is able to perceive and consider data that is foreign to their
internal value system, the INFP needs to know that its value system is not threatened by
the new information. The INFP must consciously tell himself/herself that an opinion that
does not concede with their own is not an indictment of their entire character.
The INFP who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their
motivation for taking in information. Do they take in information to better understand a
situation or concept? Or, do they take in information to support a personal idea or cause?
At the moment when something is perceived, is the INFP concerned with twisting that
perception to fit in with their personal values? Or is she/he concerned with absorbing the
information objectively? To achieve a better understanding of the external world, the
INFP should try to perceive information objectively, before fitting it into their value
system. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard anything that
doesn't agree with their values, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should
try to see situations from other people's perspectives, without making personal judgments
about the situations or the other people's perspectives. In general, they should work on
exercising their iNtuition in a truly Extraverted sense. In other words, they should use
iNtuition to take in information about the world around them for the sake of
understanding the world, rather than take in information to support their own conclusions.
The INFP who successfully perceives things objectively may be quite a powerful force
for positive change.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some INFP’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of
an unawareness of appropriate social behavior, an unawareness of how they come across
to others, or unrealistic expectations of others. Any one of these three issues stem from
using Extraverted iNtuition in a diminished manner. An INFP who takes in information
for the sake of understanding the world around them, rather than one who takes in
information only to support their own ideas, will have a clearer, more objective
understanding of how society values social behaviors and attitudes. He or she will also be
more aware of how they are perceived by others, and will have more realistic
expectations for others' behavior within a relationship. Such well-adjusted INFP’s will fit
happily into our society.
Unless you really understand Psychological Type and the nuances of the various
personality functions, it's a difficult task to suddenly start to use iNtuition in an
Extraverted direction. It's difficult to even understand what that means, much less to
incorporate that directive into your life. With that in mind, I am providing some specific
suggestions that may help you to begin exercising your Extraverted iNtuition more fully:
Take care to notice what people look like in different social situations. Look at their hair,
their skin, their makeup (or lack thereof), their clothes, the condition of their clothes, their
shoes, their facial expressions. Don't compare others to your own appearance, or pass
judgment on their appearance, simply take in the information.
Think of a situation in your life in which you weren't sure how to behave. Now try to
understand how one or two other people would see the situation. Don't compare their
behavior to your own, i.e. "she would know better than me what to do", or "why is it so
easy for her, but so hard for me". Rather, try to understand how they would see the
situation. Would it be seen as a problem, or as an opportunity? Would it be taken
seriously or lightly? Try to determine their point of view without passing judgment or
comparing it to your own.
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time
to talking about the other person. Concentrate on really understanding where that person
is coming from with their concerns. Ask questions.
Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself
"this person has their own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life
than they are with mine." Remember that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you.
It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize what that person is doing right now. What
things are they encountering, what thoughts are they having? Don't pass judgment, or
compare their situation to your own.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any
length of time.`,

    explanationOfProblems: `Most of the problems described above are a result of Introverted iNtuition overtaking the
INTJ's personality to the point that all of the other functions become slaves to Introverted
iNtuition. A healthy personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and
auxiliary functions. For an INTJ, the dominant Introverted iNtuition needs to be well supported by the auxiliary Extraverted Thinking function. If Extraverted Thinking exists
only to support the desires of Introverted iNtuition, then neither function is being used to
its potential.
Introverted iNtuition is a personality function that constantly gathers information, and
sees everything from many different perspectives. As the dominant player in a
personality, it has the effect of constantly bombarding the psyche with new information
to consider. Introverted iNtuition is sort of like a framework for understanding that exists
in the mind. As something is perceived, it is melded into the existing intuitive framework.
If an entirely new piece of information is perceived by the Introverted iNtuitive, that
person must redefine their entire framework of reference. So, Introverted iNtuitives are
constantly taking in information about the world that needs to be processed in a relatively
lengthy manner in order to be understood. That presents quite a challenge to the INTJ. It's
not unusual for an INTJ to feel overwhelmed with all of the things that he or she needs to
consider in order to fully understand an idea or situation.
When Introverted iNtuition dominates the INTJ such that the other functions cannot serve
their own purposes, we find the INTJ cutting off information that it needs to consider. If
the psyche is presented with information that looks anything like something that
Introverted iNtuition has processed in the past, it uses Extraverted Thinking to quickly
reject that information. The psyche uses Extraverted Thinking to reject the ideas, rather
than analyzing the information within its intuitive framework, and therefore reduces the
likelihood that the framework will have to be reshaped and redefined.
Using Extraverted Thinking in this manner serves the INTJ's psyche in two ways: 1) it
saves it the energy that would have to be expended to truly consider new information, and
2) it protects the INTJ's sacred inner world. In either case, it is not ideal. It causes the
INTJ to not consider information that may be useful or critical in developing a real
understanding of an issue. It also probably causes the INTJ to come off as too strongly
opinionated or snobbish to others.
The better use of Extraverted Thinking for an INTJ would be to use it to assess the INTJ's
rich insights and weigh them against the external world. When the INTJ personality uses
Extraverted Thinking to cut off incoming information, rather than to judge internal
intuitions, it is effectively cheating itself. It's like getting the answers to a test without
having to really understand the questions. It's easier to get the answer right away, rather
than to have to figure everything out. For the INTJ, who has a tremendous amount of
information and "studying" that needs to be done, it's very tempting to take shortcuts.
Most INTJ’s will do this to some extent. The real problems occur when an INTJ
personality has become so imbalanced that its owner is extremely self-important and
rarely consider anyone else's opinions or ideas.
`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the INTJ needs to focus on applying their judgment to things
only after they have gone through their intuition. In other words, the INTJ needs to
consciously try not to use their judgment to dismiss ideas prematurely. Rather, they
should use their judgment against their own ideas. One cannot effectively judge
something that they don't understand. The INTJ needs to take things entirely into their
intuition in order to understand them. It may be necessary to give your intuition enough
time to work through the new information so that it can rebuild its global framework of
understanding. INTJ’s need to focus on using their judgment not to dismiss ideas, but
rather to support their intuitive framework.
An INTJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the subject of
their judgments, and their motivation for making judgments. Are they judging something
external to themselves, or are they judging something that they have sifted through their
intuition? Is the motivation for judging something to be able to understand its usefulness
in the world, or to dismiss it? Too often, an INTJ will judge something without properly
understanding it, and with the intention of dismissing it. Seek first to understand, then to
judge.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some INTJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally
associated with not knowing (or caring) how they come across to others, with having
unreasonable expectations for others' behaviors, and with not putting forth effort to meet
others' emotional needs. These issues stem primarily from the common INTJ habit of
using Extraverted Thinking to find fault externally, rather than internally, and therefore
diminish the importance of the external world, and increase the importance of the INTJ's
own internal world. INTJ’s who recognize that their knowledge and understanding (and
therefore general happiness and feeling of success) can be enriched by the synergy of
other people's knowledge and understanding will find that they can be committed to their
rich internal worlds and still have satisfying relationships with others. In order to
accomplish this, the INTJ needs to recognize the importance of extraversion, and develop
their highest extraverted function, Extraverted Thinking.
An INTJ who uses Extraverted Thinking to find fault externally rather than internally
may become so strongly opinionated that they form rigid and unreasonable expectations
for others. Their hyper-vigilant judgments about the rationality and competence of others
may be a very effective way of keeping themselves at an emotional distance from others.
This will preserve the sanctity of the INTJ's inner world of ideas, but will reduce a lot of
valuable input, arrest the development of their social character, and stagnate the
development of the INTJ's rich structural framework of understanding. In extreme cases,
the INTJ may find himself or herself quite along and lonely.
More commonly, an INTJ's interpersonal problems will occur when they express their
displeasure to those close to them in very biting and hurtful terms. Everyone needs
emotional distance at one time or another and the INTJ wants more than most types.
Perhaps this is why INTJ’s are famous for their biting sarcasm. An INTJ's internal world
is extremely important to them. They may be protecting their internal world by using
sarcasm to keep others at an emotional distance, or they may be sarcastic with others
because they believe that they have the more evolved and logical understanding of the
issue at hand, and seek to cut off the spurious input that they're receiving. This is an
important distinction to recognize. An INTJ who is seeking an emotional respite can find
ways to be alone that don't require injuring feelings and damaging relationships. When
distance is required, the INTJ should just "leave". If an explanation is necessary, an INTJ
should use their Extraverted Thinking to explain their need rationally and objectively,
rather than using Extraverted Thinking to insult the other person, and therefore prod them
into leaving.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Take care to listen to someone's idea entirely before you pass judgment on it. Ask
questions if necessary. Do whatever it takes to make sure that you understand the idea.

Before you begin talking to another person, pause for a moment and look at that person.
Take in that person's attitude and feelings at that moment. Be aware of the person with
whom you're speaking.
If you become upset, walk away immediately. DO NOT express anger. When you get
angry, you lose. After you have calmed down, apologize for leaving and continue with
what you were doing.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you encounter frequently in your life.
Remember that people with the Sensing preference need to be communicated with in a
direct, concise manner. Speak plainly and simply with Sensors, giving "yes" or "no"

Try to be on good terms with all people, even those that you consider beneath you. Try to
understand that everybody has something to offer.
When you make judgments or decisions, try to be aware of your motivation for making

own understanding? Seek first to understand, and then to judge`,

    relationshipStrengths: [
      "ANALYTICAL – Logicians analyze everything that they come across, from research data to the behavior of the people around them. This gives them a knack for spotting unexpected patterns and connections that other personality types might overlook.",
      "ORIGINAL – Thanks to their unrelenting imagination, Logicians can come up with creative, counterintuitive ideas that wouldn’t occur to most people. Not all of these ideas are feasible, of course, but Logicians’ willingness to think outside the box can produce remarkable innovations.",
      "OPEN-MINDED – Logicians are driven by curiosity and an intense desire to learn everything that they can. People with this personality type tend to be receptive to new ideas and ways of doing things – as long as those ideas are supported by sound reasoning.",
      "CURIOUS – These personalities are always casting about for new pursuits, hobbies, and areas of research. One week, they might be obsessed with geophysics, and the next, they might lose themselves in videos about guitar building. When inspiration strikes, Logicians go all in on their newfound interest, learning everything that they can.",
      "OBJECTIVE – Logicians care about the truth. Rather than taking comfort in ideology or received ideas, they want to understand what’s really going on beneath the surface of things. As a result, they can be relied upon to combat bias and misinformation, even when it isn’t easy to do so – and they expect other people to be honest with them in return.",

    relationshipWeaknesses: [
      "DISCONNECTED – Logicians can get lost in their own train of thought, even when they’re with other people. When these personalities finally resurface with something to say, they may find that the conversation has moved on without them. This can cause them to feel disconnected from other people, especially in large social gatherings.",
      "INSENSITIVE – People with this personality type see rationality as the key to a better, happier world. At times, they may underestimate the importance of such irrational values as emotion, compassion, etiquette, and tradition. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as insensitive or unkind, even though their intentions are generally good.",
      "DISSATISFIED – Logicians can’t help but imagine how things could be better than they already are. These personalities are constantly on the lookout for problems to solve, topics to learn, and new ways to approach things. Taken too far, this mindset can become overwhelming, with Logicians constantly trying to reinvent the wheel rather than reliably addressing their needs and responsibilities.",
      "IMPATIENT – Logicians take pride in their knowledge and in sharing their ideas. When it comes to explaining their rationale, however, they aren’t always patient. If their conversation partner doesn’t follow along or seem sufficiently interested, Logicians may give up with a dismissive “never mind.”",
      "PERFECTIONIST – Logicians want to get things done, but their quest for perfection can get in the way. At times, these personalities may get so lost in analyzing various options that they never reach a decision. They may also give up on projects that don’t match the ideal vision in their mind.",

    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various
degrees to the common INTP problem of only taking in information that relates to or
supports their own life experience. The INTP is driven to work with and understand his
or her world by applying logic (an immediate, spatial, "fuzzy" logic) to the current
situation. Although they generally seek to uncover truths, they don't always have a goal
in mind to achieve from the logical process. The act or process of using logic is
rewarding to the INTP. In their zeal for the satisfaction that comes from mastering a
problem or situation, INTP’s often selectively choose to put themselves in situations in
which they have the opportunity to exercise these skills. That's certainly not a problem.
Most personality types choose to do the things that they're best at most often. Such is the
nature of capitalizing upon our strengths. The problem rears its ugly head when the goal
of the INTP becomes to achieve their personal satisfaction at all costs.
It is healthy to choose your paths and goals in life so that they coincide with what you
find rewarding, and what you're really good at. However, it sometimes happens that we
take this approach a bit too far and sacrifice an accurate and objective understanding of
the world for a more narrow vision that is easier and comfortable for us to deal with. The
INTP affects this problem when they stop taking in information in a truly objective sense,
and instead only take in information that can be worked through logically.
The dominant function of the INTP is Introverted Thinking. This function is supported
closely and importantly by the auxiliary function of Extraverted Intuition. Extraverted
Intuition perceives the world and sends information into the psyche, where it is processed
by Introverted Thinking. An INTP who uses their Extraverted Intuition function in a
diminished way is one who perceives information for the sole purpose of feeding
Introverted Thinking, rather than taking everything in objectively. They are less
concerned with understanding something for the sake of understanding than they are with
feeding a piece of data into their Thinking function. Information that is not logical is
dismissed as unimportant. They may reject information that is not consistent with their
logical view of themselves, or with their understanding of a situation. Well-developed
Extraverted Intuition perceives situations with depth and global understanding. It
recognizes possibilities. Introverted Thinking makes conclusions. If an INTP's psyche is
serving the purposes of Introverted Thinking above all else, then logical conclusions
become more important than possibilities. In such cases, the INTP picks and chooses
information from Extraverted Intuition that is interesting to them from the perspective of
reaching logical conclusions. This keeps the INTP focused on reaching logical
conclusions, but it prevents them from taking in any information that doesn't work well
with their logical functioning. This includes things like love, emotions, social
expectations, etc. These things are very important to many people in the world, and
cannot be discarded from consideration if one hopes to really understand other people
and the society that we live in. When the INTP dismisses the importance of data that can't
be handled by their Thinking function, they are dismissing the importance of ideas that
are central to half of the personality types' way of life (approximately half of the human
population uses Feeling primarily for decision making). An INTP who wants to
understand people and wants to recognize value in both logical and non logical ideas will
strive to take in as much information as possible about the world for the purposes of
improving their understanding,
The INTP who suffers from diminished use of Extraverted Intuition is likely to be very
cutting and derisive towards people who express disagreement with the INTP. Without a
sufficiently diverse perception of the Extraverted world, the INTP is unlikely to
understand the principles of human interaction, and is unlikely to recognize the
tremendous value of getting along with others and having good relationships.
For example, an INTP that I know (Bob) and his wife recently adopted a 7 year old girl
(Kelly). The family lives in a foreign country and makes it back to the U.S. for Christmas
most years. Last year, Bob's relatives from the U.S. spoiled Kelly with lots of Christmas
gifts to let her know that she was welcome and valued in their family. When Bob and his
family left the country after Christmas, they did not bring any of Kelly's Christmas gifts
with them. Bob's relatives were all extremely hurt and upset by this fact. When they
confronted Bob about this, he claimed that they were wrong. He said that he had done the
packing himself and was sure that nothing had been left behind. Bob's family has a large
stack of clothes and toys that were meant for Kelly, but Bob insists to this day that they
are wrong. He is not seeing the situation objectively with Extraverted Intuition. Rather,
he dismisses the evidence because it doesn't support his own vision of himself or of that
particular situation.
The INTP's inferior (fourth) function is Extraverted Feeling. This means that the INTP is
not naturally in tune with how other people are feeling, or with social expectations. In
fact, the INTP is likely to reject the importance of social rituals, rules, and expectations.
This is a natural weak point for the INTP, which no doubt causes strife to the INTP and
their love partner. This weakness can be overcome by developing their Extraverted
Intuition to the point that they can perceive Feeling type expectations in the external
world. They don't have to use Extraverted Feeling to understand how to act in situations.
They can perceive the expected behavior from their Extraverted Intuition function.
However, if they are restricting their incoming data to only those things that support their
existing way of life, then they are not learning from Extraverted Intuition at all. They are
not growing their understanding of social and intimate behaviors - rather, they are
reducing the importance of this type of understanding to their own life. In these
situations, INTP’s shy away from very close personal relationships, and feel more
vulnerable and less sure of themselves in situations that involve expressing their
emotions. In extreme cases, they reject social interaction entirely. They tend to dislike
everyone, and interact with the world with the primary purpose of getting rid of the
offending person. Most INTP’s will have bad days during which they don't much feel like
dealing with people. The problem occurs when every day becomes a bad day.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the INTP needs to focus on taking in as much information as
possible through Extraverted Intuition. He or she needs to allow themselves to get into
situations that they aren't necessarily comfortable with, or that are different from the
situations that they would normally choose in life. The INTP learns from experience, so
the best way for the INTP to grow as a person is to open him or herself to new
experiences. Be aware of the tendency to want to run out and do something "new" that is
actually just a different opportunity to exercise a known skill. Your task, as a person
interested in personal growth, is to understand the world in a truly objective fashion, and
how you fit into the world, rather than how the world fits into your life.
The INTP should also pay close attention to their motivations when perceiving new
information. Are they perceiving with an open mind or with an agenda? Are they seeking
to truly understand something, or are they more concerned with turning the information
into a logical conclusion? Seek first to understand, then to judge.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `The problems that INTP’s have with regards to fitting into our world are not usually
related to platonic friendships. Usually, the INTP has trouble finding and maintaining a
love relationship. The INTP usually has relatively simple needs and expectations from
their mates, and they're surprised and confused to find that their mates have more
complex demands. They don't understand their mate's needs, and may feel inadequate to
meeting them. They get very uncomfortable with a situation as they perceive that they are
expected to do something that it unknown to them. They back away from the relationship.
They generally mask their fear and discomfort by reducing the importance of the
relationship to themselves and others, or by putting the failure off onto the ridiculous
expectations of their ex-mate. Outside of a relationship, they feel more unloved and
unappreciated, but are afraid to commit to a relationship because they fear rejection and
hurt.
Most INTP’s experience relationship difficulties at some point in their lives. The INTP
with a well-developed Extraverted Intuition will find relationships more satisfying and
easier to deal with. Accordingly, we offer some general suggestions for dealing with
relationships, as well as some advice that will help the INTP develop their Extraverted
Intuition.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Figure out how you feel about the other person. Do not falsely express love, or lead
someone on with your ambivalence.
Don't expect yourself to be a master at the "touchy-feely" game. Be yourself, but
remember that there is a basic assumption of human decency that must be adhered to in
relationships. If you're not sure what that means, take special care to observe how people
in "good" committed relationships behave towards each other, so that you can determine
where the lines are drawn.
Pair yourself with an Extraverted Thinker (ESTJ or ENTJ) who is less likely to assume
that the lack of feedback is the same thing as negative feedback.
Realize and accept that for you a satisfying relationship will start with the head, and
move on towards the heart.
Expanding your world and experiences will expand your understanding of human
expectations. Try to figure out the personality type of people that you know and
encounter in your life.
Take care to notice what people look like in different social situations. Notice their hair,
makeup (or lack thereof), the condition of their clothes, their shoes, their facial
expressions. Don't compare others to your own appearance, simply take notice of it.
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, spend at least half of the time
talking about them. Concentrate on really understanding where the person is coming from
with their concerns. Ask questions.
Think of the people who are closest to you. Remember that they have their own lives
going on. Try to visualize what that person is doing, and imagine what kinds of things
that person is thinking about. Don't pass judgment, just think about it.`,

    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Realize your gift at mastering logical problems and
situations, and give yourself plenty of opportunities to exercise your abilities.
Much of your sense of well-being will come from these experiences.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! We all have weaknesses. Recognizing your weaknesses
for what they are (without beating yourself up) will give you the power to change
your life for the better.`,
      `Talk About Your Thoughts. Discussing your ideas and perceptions with others
will help you to develop your Extraverted INtuition, and thus your understanding
of the world. How well you use your auxiliary function is very important to your
overall health and happiness.`,
      `Listen to Everything Try not to dismiss anything immediately. Let it soak in, and
then apply judgment. Try not to dismiss things that are illogical - they are not
illogical.`,
      `Be Aware of Others Understand that everyone has their own lives and their own
perspectives. Everyone has something to offer. Try to identify people's
personality type.`,
      `Recognize Social Principles. Realize that our society functions around some basic
social principles, and that our society would fail unless those principles are
recognized and upheld. In a democracy, people vote. At a red stoplight, people
stop. If people stopped voting because it wasn't important them, who would be in
power? If people stopped stopping at red stop lights because it didn't fit into their
plans, how could we drive safely? Your priorities and plans are important, but you
must recognize that the external world's agenda is also important. Don't dismiss
the importance of principles that don't affect your life directly.`,
      `Get Out of Your Comfort Zone Understand that the only way to grow is to get
outside of your comfort zone. If you're uncomfortable with an idea or situation
because you're not sure how to act, that's good! That's an opportunity for growth.`,
      `Identify and Express Your Feelings You may have a hard time understanding how
you feel about someone. It's important that you do figure this out. Don't lead
someone on with your ambivalence. If you determine that you value the person,
tell them so every time you think of it. This is the best way to make them feel
secure in your affections, and so to promote a long-lasting relationship.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself Remember that no one has more control over your
life than you have. Don't be a victim.`,
      `Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself with fear and dark expectations.
Remember that a positive attitude often creates positive situations.`,

    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various
degrees to the ISFJ’s internally mapped and abstract view of the world not being
successfully coupled to an appropriate level of Extroverted feeling. Without this rational
external balance, the ISFJ’s opposing unconscious functions can wreak havoc upon the
order and sense of the ISFJ’s perceptions and ideas. ISFJ’s are usually stable, certain,
reliable and deft in their approach to life. But if unbalanced, they are likely to treat any
point of view other than their own with a kind of cold dismay, and if pressed hard will
tend to shut out the existence of problems caused by others differing attitudes and
opinions. If the ISFJ does not learn how to deal with the wide range of differing world
views they come into contact with, they can find themselves closed into a lonely little
corner of the world in which only their own feelings of safety and certainty are
maintained. This is a natural survival technique for the extreme ISFJ personality.
The main driver to the ISFJ personality is Introverted Sensing, whose function is to
define the properties of and locate and recognize the sometimes abstract and innate
qualities of and between the objects of the outer world. If an ISFJ’s picture of the world
is threatened by external influences, the ISFJ generally tries to shut such new information
out of their lives. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the individual psyche
from getting hurt. However, the ISFJ who exercises this type of self-protection regularly
will become closed within a small and ever decreasing circle of those family and friends
who do not actively disturb their increasingly narrow and rigid world view. They will
always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and will always find fault
with the outside world for problems that they have in their lives. It will be difficult for
them to maintain close personal relationships because they will have a negatively
polarized and therefore limited ability to communicate outside of the box of their own
security needs.
It is not an uncommon tendency for the ISFJ to support their ideas and values by using
only the value judgments they make about the world and other peoples behavior.
However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting ISFJ personality is too self centered to be happy or successful. Since the ISFJ's dominant function is Introverted
Sensing, they must balance this with an auxiliary Extraverted Feeling function. If the
ISFJ uses Extraverted Feeling only to serve the purposes of Introverted Sensing, then the
ISFJ is not using Extraversion effectively at all. As a result, the ISFJ does not sufficiently
recognize and sympathize with the way feelings affect the behavior of others in the world
to have a good sense of why things happen as they do. They see nothing but their own
perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in order to support their
perspective. These individuals usually come across as somewhat judgmental and full of
fixed and often rather ambiguously polarized ideas about the world. Other people are
often surprised by the vehemence of their ideas and are usually unable to understand how
they came by them.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ISFJ needs to focus on opening their perspective to include
a more accurate picture of the feelings and value judgments of others. In order to be in a
position in which the ISFJ is able to perceive and consider data that is foreign to their
internal value system, the ISFJ needs to recognize that their world view is not threatened
by the new information. The ISFJ must consciously tell himself/herself that emotional
affects in others are not unrelated to reality; that the feelings of others are also just and
valid within a wider and less rigorous vision of the world.
The ISFJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their
motivation for deciding what is good and bad, right and wrong. Do they try to find the
feeling values of others in a situation? Or, do they value only those feelings which
support a personal idea or cause? At the moment when something is felt, is the ISFJ only
concerned with whether that feeling supports something they recognize as correct? Or is
she/he concerned with becoming truly empathetic? To achieve a better understanding of
others and the world in which they live, the ISFJ should try to put themselves into the
minds of others, to locate and recognize how they have come to feel the way they do,
before making judgments. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard
anything that doesn't agree with their carefully ordered concepts, and work towards
lessening this tendency. They should try to feel the way others would feel in situations,
without making personal judgments about the actual situations. In general, they should
work on exercising their Feeling in a truly extraverted sense. In other words, they should
use Feeling to locate the their true connections to and relationship with others for the sake
of gaining a wider perspective, rather than only allowing such feeling values to support
their own conclusions. The ISFJ who successfully feels things objectively may be quite a
powerful force for positive change.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some ISFJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of
an inability to flow with what is, a too negative or correcting attitude which dismays
others, or unrealistic ideals and ideas about the world. These issues mostly stem from
using Extraverted Feeling in a diminished manner: the lack of a strong externally focused
value system allowing an often ambiguous and yet strongly defended world view which
has little relation to concrete reality to control the personality. An ISFJ who attempts to
feel and value the feelings of others for the sake of understanding the world around them,
rather than quickly deciding how they and they alone feel, will have a clearer, more
objective understanding of how society is dependant not only upon structure and correct
behavior, but also how human values make it just what it is and not something else
perhaps more desirable. He or she will also be more comfortable and less likely to
demand that the world and the behavior of others conform to some abstract code of being.
Such well-adjusted ISFJ’s will fit happily into our society. Unless you really understand
Psychological Type and the nuances of the various personality functions, it's a difficult
task to suddenly start to use Feeling in an unambiguous and totally extraverted direction.
It's difficult to even understand what that means, much less to incorporate that directive
into your life. With that in mind, I am providing some specific suggestions that may help
you to begin exercising your Extraverted Feeling more fully:
Take care to try and discover why others feel the way they do. Try to notice the
connections between their feelings and the way they see the world. Don’t immediately
compare your own value judgments about the world to theirs; simply accept that for them
this is a real and perfectly valid way of responding.
Think of those times and situations in your life when you felt misunderstood or
disregarded by others. Now try to understand how one or two other people would see the
situation. Don't try to assume they would judge as you do: "she would have to feel the
same way if that happened to her", or "he would change his tune if he saw things from
my point of view". Rather, try to understand how they would truly see the situation.
Would it be seen as a problem, or as an opportunity? Would it be taken seriously or
lightly? Try to determine their point of view without passing judgment or comparing it to
your own.
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time
to finding out how the other person feels about what they are describing. Concentrate on
really sensing their emotional state. Tell them how you feel and compare. Ask questions
about why they feel as they do.
Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself
"this person has their own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life
than they are with mine." Remember that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you.
It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize what that person is feeling right now.
What emotions are they enacting, what thoughts are they having? Don't pass judgment, or
compare their situation to your own.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any
length of time.`,

      `Discover the World of Others. Don't let yourself fall into the trap of thinking you
always know what is right for others. Open your heart to the possibility of
understanding that their true needs are something that must be discovered
through relationship, and recognition that their world might be very different, yet

    successDefinition: `1. LIVING IN HARMONY - Unless I take time for myself, I can end up feeling lost in the tide of everyday life, constantly reacting to external circumstances instead of making my own way. Creative and free-spirited, I march to the beat of my own drum, and it would be easy to assume that I don’t particularly worry what other people think of me. But this isn’t the case – I am  thoughtful and perceptive, able to pick up on people’s unspoken feelings and opinions, and it can upset me if I don’t feel liked, approved of, or appreciated. When faced with criticism, it can be a challenge for me not to get caught up in the heat of the moment. If I encounter harsh or seemingly unfair criticism, I may even lose my temper in spectacular fashion. 
    2. THE BEAUTY OF AN OPEN MIND - I want to live in a world where me, and everyone else, have the freedom to live as I see fit, without judgment. I embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. Some people thrive on strict schedules and routines, but not me. I take each day as it comes, doing what feels right to me in the moment. And I make sure to leave plenty of room in their life for the unexpected, with the result that many of my most cherished memories are of spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures, whether by myself or with my loved ones.`,

    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various
degrees to the ISFJ’s internally mapped and abstract view of the world not being
successfully coupled to an appropriate level of Extroverted feeling. Without this rational
external balance, the ISFJ’s opposing unconscious functions can wreak havoc upon the
order and sense of the ISFJ’s perceptions and ideas. ISFJ’s are usually stable, certain,
reliable and deft in their approach to life. But if unbalanced, they are likely to treat any
point of view other than their own with a kind of cold dismay, and if pressed hard will
tend to shut out the existence of problems caused by others differing attitudes and
opinions. If the ISFJ does not learn how to deal with the wide range of differing world
views they come into contact with, they can find themselves closed into a lonely little
corner of the world in which only their own feelings of safety and certainty are
maintained. This is a natural survival technique for the extreme ISFJ personality.
The main driver to the ISFJ personality is Introverted Sensing, whose function is to
define the properties of and locate and recognize the sometimes abstract and innate
qualities of and between the objects of the outer world. If an ISFJ’s picture of the world
is threatened by external influences, the ISFJ generally tries to shut such new information
out of their lives. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the individual psyche
from getting hurt. However, the ISFJ who exercises this type of self-protection regularly
will become closed within a small and ever decreasing circle of those family and friends
who do not actively disturb their increasingly narrow and rigid world view. They will
always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and will always find fault
with the outside world for problems that they have in their lives. It will be difficult for
them to maintain close personal relationships because they will have a negatively
polarized and therefore limited ability to communicate outside of the box of their own
security needs.
It is not an uncommon tendency for the ISFJ to support their ideas and values by using
only the value judgments they make about the world and other peoples behavior.
However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting ISFJ personality is too self centered to be happy or successful. Since the ISFJ's dominant function is Introverted
Sensing, they must balance this with an auxiliary Extraverted Feeling function. If the
ISFJ uses Extraverted Feeling only to serve the purposes of Introverted Sensing, then the
ISFJ is not using Extraversion effectively at all. As a result, the ISFJ does not sufficiently
recognize and sympathize with the way feelings affect the behavior of others in the world
to have a good sense of why things happen as they do. They see nothing but their own
perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in order to support their
perspective. These individuals usually come across as somewhat judgmental and full of
fixed and often rather ambiguously polarized ideas about the world. Other people are
often surprised by the vehemence of their ideas and are usually unable to understand how
they came by them.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ISFJ needs to focus on opening their perspective to include
a more accurate picture of the feelings and value judgments of others. In order to be in a
position in which the ISFJ is able to perceive and consider data that is foreign to their
internal value system, the ISFJ needs to recognize that their world view is not threatened
by the new information. The ISFJ must consciously tell himself/herself that emotional
affects in others are not unrelated to reality; that the feelings of others are also just and
valid within a wider and less rigorous vision of the world.
The ISFJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their
motivation for deciding what is good and bad, right and wrong. Do they try to find the
feeling values of others in a situation? Or, do they value only those feelings which
support a personal idea or cause? At the moment when something is felt, is the ISFJ only
concerned with whether that feeling supports something they recognize as correct? Or is
she/he concerned with becoming truly empathetic? To achieve a better understanding of
others and the world in which they live, the ISFJ should try to put themselves into the
minds of others, to locate and recognize how they have come to feel the way they do,
before making judgments. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard
anything that doesn't agree with their carefully ordered concepts, and work towards
lessening this tendency. They should try to feel the way others would feel in situations,
without making personal judgments about the actual situations. In general, they should
work on exercising their Feeling in a truly extraverted sense. In other words, they should
use Feeling to locate the their true connections to and relationship with others for the sake
of gaining a wider perspective, rather than only allowing such feeling values to support
their own conclusions. The ISFJ who successfully feels things objectively may be quite a
powerful force for positive change.`,

The same applies to criticisms, for others and themselves.",
      "CREATE AND ENFORCE ORDER – The primary goal of any Logistician is to be effective in what they’ve chosen to do, and they believe that this is accomplished best when everyone involved knows exactly what is going on and why. Unclear guidelines and people who break established rules undermine this effort, and are rarely tolerated by Logisticians.

      "OFTEN UNREASONABLY BLAME THEMSELVES – All this can combine to make Logisticians believe they are the only ones who can see projects through reliably. As they load themselves with extra work and responsibilities, turning away good intentions and helpful ideas, Logisticians sooner or later hit a tipping point where they simply can’t deliver. Since they’ve heaped the responsibility on themselves, Logisticians then believe the responsibility for failure is theirs alone to bear.",

    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various
degrees to the common ISTJ problem of Introverted Sensing overtaking the ISTJ's
personality to the point that all other functions become slaves to Introverted Sensing. A
more "whole" personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and
auxiliary functions. For an ISTJ, the dominant Introverted Sensing needs to be well supported by the auxiliary Extraverted Thinking function. If Extraverted Thinking exists
only to support the desires of Introverted Sensing, than neither function is being used to
its potential.
Introverted Sensing is a personality function that constantly gathers data and stores it in a
sort of informational database to be accessed at will in the future. As the dominant player
in a personality, it has the effect of constantly bombarding the psyche with facts to store.
As something new is perceived, it is added to the vast warehouse of Introverted Sensing
data. Introverted Sensing does not in itself analyze this data for meaning or connection--it
just takes it in as information. In order to sort through and make use of this information, a
judging function must be applied. It is the judging function that does the analysis and
ordering of the data.
When Introverted Sensing is too dominant, or Extraverted Thinking is not developed
sufficiently, we see the ISTJ using Extraverted Thinking to order the individual's world in
such a way that Introverted Sensing can reign without interference. This may include
dismissing the importance of relationships, or pushing away anything that threatens the
ISTJ's highly introverted way of life. In this manner, Extraverted Thinking is used against
the external world, rather than against the ISTJ's internal data. It is a defensive shield,
rather than a useful filter.
The better, more "whole" use of Extraverted Thinking for the ISTJ would be to use it to
order and evaluate its own rich store of data, and therefore generate useful solutions to
problems and efficient systems. Like all types, most ISTJ’s will show some signs of this
kind of weakness. This does not mean that they're hopelessly flawed. The real problems
occur when an ISTJ personality has become so imbalanced that its owner is extremely
selfish and unable to consider the importance or validity of anyone else's perspective.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ISTJ needs to focus on applying their judgment against
information that they have gathered, rather than against single facts or ideas coming from
others. Before judging, put all new data into the context of existing facts. Working with
all of the facts at your disposal will greatly improve your ability to judge effectively, and
will reduce the likelihood that you will become offensively reactionary and isolationist.
An ISTJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the subject of
there judgments, and their motivations for making judgments. Are they judging
something external to themselves, or are they judging something within the context of
their stored knowledge? Is the motivation for judging something to be able to understand
its usefulness in the world, or to dismiss it? Too often, an ISTJ will judge something
without properly understanding it, and with the intention of dismissing it. Seek first to
understand, then to judge.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `People of all personality types sometimes experience problems dealing with specific
aspects of civilization and human interaction. For the ISTJ, problems are generally
associated with being unable to tolerate behaviors that go outside perceived norms, and
with not putting forth effort to meet others' emotional needs. These problems stem from
building up the importance of the ISTJ's inner world and diminishing the importance of
the external world. ISTJ’s who recognize that their knowledge and experience can be
enriched by the synergy of other people's knowledge and experience will find that they
can be committed to their internal worlds and still have satisfying relationships with
others. The key to accomplishing this is development of their highest extraverted
function, Extraverted Thinking.
An ISTJ who uses Extraverted Thinking to find fault externally rather than internally may
become so strongly opinionated that they form rigid and unreasonable expectations of
others. Their hyper-vigilant judgments about the rationality and competence of others
may be a very effective way of keeping themselves at an emotional distance from others.
This will preserve the sanctity of the ISTJ's inner world and lifestyle, but will reduce a lot
of valuable input, arrest the development of their social character, and stagnate the
development of the ISTJ's rich store of experiential data. In extreme cases the ISTJ may
find him or herself quite alone and lonely.
More commonly, the ISTJ will run into trouble when they try to order and structure the
outer world, rather than their inner world. Trying to structure people into a predefined,
acceptable system is problematic. The personality types who value the unique individual
will be offended by the apparent lack of respect for their person, and people with
personality types who follow social values will want to be honoring their own system,
rather then being forced to follow yours. Many people experience being controlled or
manipulated as a form of suppression, and resist it. Eventually, they may harbor serious
resentment against the suppressor.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Take care to listen to someone's idea entirely before you pass judgment on it. Ask
questions if necessary. Do whatever it takes to make sure that you understand the idea.
Try not to begin judging anything until you understand the details.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone you encounter frequently in your life.
Remember that Intuitives often have a wandering style of expression. Try to exhibit
tolerance for this.
Before you begin talking to another person, pause for a moment and look at that person.
Take in that person's attitude and feelings at that moment. Be aware of the person with
whom you are speaking.`,

of everything. Just as there is a positive charge for every negative charge, there is
a light side to every dark side. Remember that positive situations are created by
positive attitudes, and vice versa. Expect the best, and the best will come forward.`,
      `There is Nothing to Fear but Fear Itself. Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk to
initiate change. Don't be afraid to do so when that time comes. In most cases, the
obstacles and burdens standing in the way of your goal are not really there--they
just exist in your perspective. Change your perspective--change your life.`,

    epithet: "The Virtuoso",
    description: `Virtuosos love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, Virtuosos find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.
Virtuosos explore ideas through creating, troubleshooting, trial and error and first-hand experience. They enjoy having other people take an interest in their projects and sometimes don’t even mind them getting into their space. Of course, that’s on the condition that those people don’t interfere with Virtuosos’ principles and freedom, and they’ll need to be open to Virtuosos returning the interest in kind.
Virtuosos enjoy lending a hand and sharing their experience, especially with the people they care about, and it’s a shame they’re so uncommon, making up only about five percent of the population. Virtuoso women are especially rare, and the typical gender roles that society tends to expect can be a poor fit – they’ll often be seen as tomboys from a young age.

      "DISLIKE COMMITMENT – Long-term commitments are particularly onerous for Virtuosos. They prefer to take things day-by-day, and the feeling of being locked into something for a long time is downright oppressive. This can be a particular challenge in Virtuosos’ romantic relationships.",
      "RISKY BEHAVIOR – This stubbornness, difficulty with others’ emotions, focus on the moment, and easy boredom can lead to unnecessary and unhelpful boundary-pushing, just for fun. Virtuosos have been known to escalate conflict and danger just to see where it goes, something that can have disastrous consequences for everyone around if they lose control of the situation.",

    successDefinition: `1. DEFYING THE RULES - I have a particular difficulty in predicting emotions, but this is just a natural extension of my fairness, given how difficult it is to gauge my emotions and motivations. However, my tendency to explore my relationships through my actions rather than through empathy can lead to some very frustrating situations. I struggle with boundaries and guidelines, preferring the freedom to move about and color outside the lines if I need to.
    2.  DARE TO DIFFER - Rather than some sort of vision quest though, I am merely exploring the viability of a new interest when I make these seismic shifts. While my mechanical tendencies can make me appear simple at a glance, I am actually quite enigmatic. Friendly but very private, calm but suddenly spontaneous, extremely curious but unable to stay focused on formal studies, I can be a challenge to predict, even by my friends and loved ones. I can seem very loyal and steady for a while, but I tend to build up a store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking my interests in bold new directions.`,

    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various
degrees to the common ISTP problem of only taking in information that relates to or
supports their own life experience. The ISTP is driven to work with and understand his or
her world by applying their special brand of logic (an immediate, spatial, "fuzzy" logic)
to their physical experience. They don't necessarily have a goal in mind to achieve from
this process - it is the process itself that is rewarding to the ISTP. In their zeal for the
satisfaction that comes from mastering their physical environment in such a way, ISTP’s
often selectively choose to put themselves in situations in which they have the
opportunity to exercise these skills. That's certainly not a problem. Most personality types
choose to do the things that they're best at most often. Such is the nature of capitalizing
upon our strengths. The problem rears its ugly head when the goal of the ISTP becomes
to achieve their personal satisfaction at all costs.
It is healthy to choose your paths and goals in life so that they coincide with what you
find rewarding, and what you're really good at. However, it sometimes happens that we
take this approach a bit too far and sacrifice an accurate and objective understanding of
the world for a more narrow vision that is easier and comfortable for us to deal with. The
ISTP affects this problem when they stop taking in information in a truly objective sense,
and instead only take in information that supports their way of life.
The dominant function of the ISTP is Introverted Thinking. This function is supported
closely and importantly by the auxiliary function of Extraverted Sensing. Extraverted
Sensing perceives the world and sends information into the psyche, where it is processed
by Introverted Thinking. An ISTP who uses their Extraverted Sensing function in a
diminished way is one who chooses to restrict their environment to people and places that
support their favored activities. In such a way, the ISTP prevents his or her psyche from
having to consider data from differing viewpoints and lifestyles, and thus promotes a
lifestyle that allows them to frequently exercise and enhance their known tactile skills. It
serves their immediate needs, which are the primary focus of the ISTP. However, it also
promotes a lifestyle that is essentially self-centered and narrow in focus. It solves short term problems, and creates long-term ones.
The ISTP's inferior (fourth) function is Extraverted Feeling. This means that the ISTP is
not naturally in tune with how other people are feeling, or with social expectations. In
fact, the ISTP is likely to reject the importance of social rituals, rules, and expectations.
This is a natural weak point for the ISTP, which no doubt causes strife to the ISTP and
their love partner. This weakness can be overcome by developing their Extraverted
Sensing to the point that they can perceive Feeling type expectations in the external
world. They don't have to use Extraverted Feeling to understand how to act in situations.
They can perceive the expected behavior from their Extraverted Sensing function.
However, if they are restricting their incoming data to only those things that support their
existing way of life, then they are not learning from Extraverted Sensing at all. They are
not growing their understanding of social and intimate behaviors - rather, they are
reducing the importance of this type of understanding to their own life. In these
situations, ISTP’s shy away from very close personal relationships, and feel more
vulnerable and less sure of themselves in situations that involve expressing their
emotions.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ISTP needs to focus on taking in as much information as
possible through Extraverted Sensing. He or she needs to allow themselves to get into
situations that they aren't necessarily comfortable with, or that are different from the
situations that they would normally choose in life. The ISTP learns from experience, so
the best way for the ISTP to grow as a person is to open him or herself to new
experiences. Be aware of the tendency to want to run out and do something "new" that is
actually just a different opportunity to exercise a known skill. Your task, as a person
interested in personal growth, is to understand the world in a truly objective fashion,
rather than understanding how the world fits in with your way of life.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `ISTP’s usually have a loyal group of friends that they fit in with and feel comfortable
with. The problems that ISTP’s have with regards to fitting into our world are not usually
related to platonic friendships. Usually, the ISTP has trouble finding and maintaining a
love relationship. The ISTP usually has very simple needs and expectations from their
mates, and they're surprised and confused to find that their mates have more complex
demands. They feel inadequate to meeting their mate's needs, and begin to get very
uncomfortable with the situation as they perceive that they are expected to do something
that it unknown to them. They back away from the relationship. Outside of a relationship,
they feel more unloved and unappreciated, but are afraid to commit to a relationship
because they fear rejection and hurt.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Don't expect yourself to be a master at the "touchy-feely" game. Be yourself, but
remember that there is a basic assumption of human decency that must be adhered to in
relationships. If you're not sure what that means, take special care to observe how people
in "good" committed relationships behave towards each other, so that you can determine
where the lines are drawn.
Pair yourself with an Extraverted Thinker (ESTJ or ENTJ) who is less likely to assume
that the lack of feedback is the same thing as negative feedback.
Expanding your world and experiences will expand your understanding of human
expectations. Try to figure out the personality type of people that you know and
encounter in your life.

social principles, and that our society would fail unless those principles are
recognized and upheld. In a democracy, people vote. At a red stoplight, people
stop. If people stopped voting because it wasn't important to their own way of life,
who would be in power? If people stopped stopping at red stop lights because it
didn't fit into their way of life, how could we drive safely? Your priorities and
beliefs are important, but you must recognize that the external world's agenda is
also important. Don't dismiss the importance of principles that don't affect your
life directly.`,
      `It's OK to Get Out of your Comfort Zone. Understand that the only way to grow is
