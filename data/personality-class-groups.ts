    description: `Protagonists (ENFJs) feel called to serve a greater purpose in life. Thoughtful and idealistic, these personality types strive to have a positive impact on other people and the world around them. They rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, even when doing so is far from easy.
Protagonists are born leaders, which explains why these personalities can be found among many notable politicians, coaches, and teachers. Their passion and charisma allow them to inspire others not just in their careers but in every arena of their lives, including their relationships. Few things bring Protagonists a deeper sense of joy and fulfillment than guiding friends and loved ones to grow into their best selves.`,

    relationshipStrengths: [
      "RECEPTIVE – Protagonists have strong opinions, but they’re far from closed-minded. They recognize the importance of allowing others to express themselves fully. Even when Protagonists don’t agree with someone, they recognize that person’s right to voice their truth.",
      "RELIABLE – Few things bother Protagonists more than the prospect of letting down a person or cause that they believe in. People with this personality type can be counted on to see their promises and responsibilities through – even when it’s difficult to do so.",
      "PASSIONATE – Protagonists are far from being boring do-gooders. These types brim with interests, and they take great pleasure in pursuing their hobbies – whether that’s hiking, cooking, dancing, growing houseplants, or something else entirely. As a result, they rarely find themselves at a loss for something interesting to do.",
      "ALTRUISTIC – These personalities are known for harboring a deep desire to be a force for positive change. Protagonists genuinely believe that if they bring people together, they can do a world of good.",
      "CHARISMATIC – Determined and inspiring, Protagonists often find their way into leadership roles. Whether they’re captain of their softball team or a leader on the world stage, they rarely lose sight of their main goal: to be of service to others.",
    ],
    relationshipWeaknesses: [
      "UNREALISTIC – Many Protagonists put pressure on themselves to right every wrong that they encounter. But no matter how hard these personalities strive, it just isn’t realistic for them to solve all of the world’s problems. If they aren’t careful, they can spread themselves too thin – and be left unable to help anyone.",
      "OVERLY IDEALISTIC – Protagonists tend to have clear ideas about what’s right and what’s wrong. They often think that everyone shares these fundamental principles – or, at least, that everyone should share these principles. So it can come as a genuine shock to Protagonists when people violate their core values, such as truth or justice.",
      "CONDESCENDING – People with this personality type enjoy teaching others, particularly about the causes and beliefs that matter so much to them. But, at times, Protagonists’ attempts to “enlighten” others may come across as patronizing – not the most effective strategy for persuading other people, unfortunately",
      "INTENSE – When it comes to self-improvement, Protagonists are rarely short on energy or determination. But they may not recognize that not everyone shares these qualities. At times, Protagonists may push others to make changes that they aren’t ready for – or simply aren’t interested in making in the first place.",
      "OVERLY EMPATHETIC – Compassion is among this personality type’s greatest strengths. But Protagonists have a tendency to take on other people’s problems as their own – a habit that can leave them emotionally and physically exhausted.",

This strength of conviction bolsters my innate leadership skills, particularly my ability to guide people to work together in service of the greater good.
2. GETTING INVOLVED - I am a genuine, caring person who talks the talk and walks the walk. Nothing makes me happier than motivating other people to do what’s right.  When I care about someone, I want to help solve that person’s problems – sometimes at any cost. The good news is that many people are grateful for my assistance and advice. After all, there’s a reason that these I have a reputation for helping others improve their lives.

    epithet: "Extroverted iNtuitive Thinking Judging",
    description: `Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.`,

    ],
    relationshipStrengths: [
      "EFFICIENT – Commanders see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right, but as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an elaborate sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. People with the Commander personality type will root out such behavior wherever they go.",
      "ENERGETIC – Rather than finding this process taxing Commanders are energized by it, genuinely enjoying leading their teams forward as they implement their plans and goals.",
      "SELF-CONFIDENT – Commanders couldn’t do this if they were plagued by self-doubt – they trust their abilities, make known their opinions, and believe in their capacities as leaders.",
      "STRONG-WILLED – Nor do they give up when the going gets tough – Commander personalities strive to achieve their goals, but really nothing is quite as satisfying to them as rising to the challenge of each obstacle in their run to the finish line.",
      "STRATEGIC THINKERS – Commanders exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan, and are known for examining every angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues, but moving the whole project forward with their solutions.",
      "CHARISMATIC AND INSPIRING – These qualities combine to create individuals who are able to inspire and invigorate others, who people actually want to be their leaders, and this in turn helps Commanders to accomplish their often ambitious goals that could never be finished alone.",
    ],
    relationshipWeaknesses: [
      "STUBBORN AND DOMINANT – Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far, and Commanders are all too capable of digging in their heels, trying to win every single debate and pushing their vision, and theirs alone.",
      "INTOLERANT – “It’s my way or the highway.” People with the Commander personality type are notoriously unsupportive of any idea that distracts from their primary goals, and even more so of ideas based on emotional considerations. Commanders won’t hesitate a second to make that fact clear to those around them.",
      "IMPATIENT – Some people need more time to think than others, an intolerable delay to quick-thinking Commanders. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in their haste, a terrible mistake for a leader to make.",
      "ARROGANT – Commander personalities respect quick thoughts and firm convictions, their own qualities, and look down on those who don’t match up. This relationship is a challenge for most other personality types who are perhaps not timid in their own right, but will seem so beside overbearing Commanders.",
      "POOR HANDLING OF EMOTIONS – All this bluster, alongside the assumed supremacy of rationalism, makes Commanders distant from their own emotional expression and sometimes downright scornful of others’. People with this personality type often trample others’ feelings, inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations.",
      "COLD AND RUTHLESS – Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, especially professionally, makes Commanders incredibly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational and irrelevant.",
    ],
    successDefinition: `1. A WORTHY CHALLENGE - I am a true powerhouse, and I cultivate an image of being larger than life – and often enough I am. I need to remember though, that my stature comes not just from my own actions, but from the actions of the team that props me up, and that it’s important to recognize the contributions, talents and needs, especially from an emotional perspective, of my support network. 
    2. STRIVING FOR GREATNESS - At the negotiating table, I am dominant, relentless, and unforgiving. This isn’t because I am coldhearted or vicious per se – it’s more that I genuinely enjoy the challenge, the battle of wits, the repartee that comes from this environment, and if the other side can’t keep up, that’s no reason for me to fold on my own core tenet of ultimate victory.`,

    relationshipStrengths: [
      "CURIOUS – Campaigners can find beauty and fascination in nearly anything. Imaginative and open-minded, these personalities aren’t afraid to venture beyond their comfort zones in search of new ideas, experiences, and adventures.",
      "PERCEPTIVE – To people with this personality type, no one is unimportant – which might explain how they can pick up on even the subtlest shifts in another person’s mood or expression. Because they’re so sensitive to other people’s feelings and needs, Campaigners can make full use of their caring, considerate nature.",
      "ENTHUSIASTIC – When something captures their imagination and inspires them, Campaigners want to share it with anyone who will listen. And they’re just as eager to hear other people’s ideas and opinions – even if those thoughts are wildly different from their own.",
      "EXCELLENT COMMUNICATORS – Campaigners brim with things to say, but they can be caring listeners as well. This gives them a nearly unmatched ability to have positive and enjoyable conversations with all sorts of people – even people who aren’t particularly sociable or agreeable.",
      "FESTIVE – Campaigners may live for deep, meaningful conversations, but they can also be spontaneous and lighthearted. These personalities know how to find fun and joy in the present moment – and few things give them more pleasure than sharing their joy with others.",
      "GOOD NATURED – All of these strengths come together to form a person who is warmhearted and approachable, with an altruistic spirit and a friendly disposition. Campaigners strive to get along with pretty much everyone, and their circles of acquaintances and friends often stretch far and wide.",
    ],
    relationshipWeaknesses: [
      "PEOPLE PLEASING – Most Campaigners are uncomfortable with the prospect of being disliked. To maintain peace, they may compromise on things that matter to them or allow people to treat them poorly. And when they fail to win someone over, they might lose sleep trying to figure out what to do about it.",
      "UNFOCUSED – The thrill of a new project – especially one that involves collaborating with other people – can bring out the best in Campaigners. But this personality type is known for having ever-evolving interests, meaning that Campaigners may find it challenging to maintain discipline and focus over the long term.",
      'DISORGANIZED – Campaigners’ enthusiasm is legendary, but it doesn’t extend to everything. Specifically, people with this personality type may try to avoid boring, practical matters, such as chores, maintenance, or paperwork. The resulting sense of disorganization can become a major source of stress in their lives.',
      "OVERLY ACCOMODATING – Campaigner personalities feel called to uplift others, and they may find themselves saying yes whenever anyone asks them for guidance or help. But unless they set boundaries, even the most energetic Campaigners can become overcommitted, with too little time and energy to tackle the necessities of their own lives.",
      "OVERLY OPTIMISTIC – Optimism can be among this personality type’s key strengths. But Campaigners’ rosy outlook can lead them to make well-intentioned but naive decisions, such as believing people who haven’t earned their trust. This trait can also make it difficult for Campaigners to accept hard but necessary truths – and to share those truths with others.",
      "RESTLESS – With their positive, upbeat attitude, Campaigners rarely seem upset or dissatisfied on the outside. But their inner idealism can leave them with a nagging feeling that some major areas of their life just aren’t good enough – whether that’s their work, their home life, or their relationships.",
     ],
    successDefinition: `1. THE MAGIC OF EVERYDAY LIFE -  I am independent and creative, always on the lookout for the magic and meaning in everyday life. In my unique way, I can be quite introspective. I can’t help but ponder the deeper meaning and significance of life – even when I should be paying attention to something else. I believe that everything – and everyone – is connected, and I live for the glimmers of insight that I can gain into these connections.
    2. SEEKING JOY - I am capable of intense thought and feeling – and also of kicking back and having a good time. Even in moments of fun, I want to connect emotionally with others. Few things matter more to me than having genuine, heartfelt conversations with the people I cherish. I believe that everyone deserves to express their feelings, and their empathy and warmth create spaces where even the most timid spirits can feel comfortable opening up.`,

It would be a mistake, though, to think of Debaters as disagreeable or mean-spirited.

      "KNOWLEDGEABLE – Debaters rarely pass up a good opportunity to learn something new, especially abstract concepts. This information isn’t usually absorbed for any planned purpose as with dedicated studying, people with the Debater personality type just find it fascinating.",
      "QUICK THINKERS – Debaters have tremendously flexible minds, and are able to shift from idea to idea without effort, drawing on their accumulated knowledge to prove their points, or their opponents’, as they see fit.",
      "ORIGINAL – Having little attachment to tradition, Debater personalities are able to discard existing systems and methods and pull together disparate ideas from their extensive knowledge base, with a little raw creativity to hold them together, to formulate bold new ideas. If presented with chronic, systemic problems and given rein to solve them, Debaters respond with unabashed glee.",
      "EXCELLENT BRAINSTORMERS – Nothing is quite as enjoyable to Debaters as analyzing problems from every angle to find the best solutions. Combining their knowledge and originality to splay out every aspect of the subject at hand, rejecting without remorse options that don’t work and presenting ever more possibilities, Debaters are irreplaceable in brainstorming sessions.",
      "CHARISMATIC – People with the Debater personality type have a way with words and wit that others find intriguing. Their confidence, quick thought and ability to connect disparate ideas in novel ways create a style of communication that is charming, even entertaining, and informative at the same time.",

     ],
    relationshipWeaknesses: [
      "VERY ARGUMENTATIVE – If there’s anything Debaters enjoy, it’s the mental exercise of debating an idea, and nothing is sacred. More consensus-oriented personality types rarely appreciate the vigor with which Debater personalities tear down their beliefs and methods, leading to a great deal of tension.",
      "INSENSITIVE – Being so rational, Debaters often misjudge others feelings and push their debates well past others’ tolerance levels. People with this personality type don’t really consider emotional points to be valid in such debates either, which magnifies the issue tremendously.",
      "INTOLERANT – Unless people are able to back up their ideas in a round of mental sparring, Debaters are likely to dismiss not just the ideas but the people themselves. Either a suggestion can stand up to rational scrutiny or it’s not worth bothering with.",
      "CAN FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FOCUS – The same flexibility that allows Debaters to come up with such original plans and ideas makes them readapt perfectly good ones far too often, or to even drop them entirely as the initial excitement wanes and newer thoughts come along. Boredom comes too easily for Debaters, and fresh thoughts are the solution, though not always a helpful one.",
      `DISLIKE PRACTICAL MATTERS – Debaters are interested in what could be – malleable concepts like ideas and plans that can be adapted and debated. When it comes to hard details and day-to-day execution where creative flair isn’t just unnecessary but actually counter-productive, Debater personalities lose interest, often with the consequence of their plans never seeing the light of day.`,

Supportive and outgoing, I can always be spotted at a party – I am the one fluttering around making sure that everyone else is having a good time!

Loyal to the core, I build lasting relationships, and I can be counted on to show up whenever a helping hand, or a listening ear, is needed.
    2. THE BEAUTY OF A RESPONSIBLE LIFE - I have a clear moral compass – and it can be nothing short of baffling to me when other people’s actions don’t align with it. I believe that there is a clear right thing to do in nearly every situation. While some may adopt a more lenient, live-and-let-live attitude, I find it difficult not to judge when someone takes a path that strikes me as misguided. As a result, I often struggle to accept it when someone, particularly someone I care about, disagrees with me.`,

Tasks aren’t simply abandoned because they’ve become difficult or boring – people with the Executive personality type take them up when they are the right thing to do, and they will be finished so long as they remain the right thing to do.",
      "STRONG-WILLED – A strong will makes this dedication possible, and Executives don’t give up their beliefs because of simple opposition. Executives defend their ideas and principles relentlessly, and must be proven clearly and conclusively wrong for their stance to budge.",

New ideas suggest that their methods weren’t good enough, and abandoning what has always worked before in favor of something that may yet fail risks their image of reliability.",
      "JUDGMENTAL – Executives have strong convictions about what is right, wrong, and socially acceptable.

    successDefinition: `1. A GREATER RESPONSIBILITY - I am the classic image of the model citizen: I help my neighbors, uphold the law, and try to make sure that everyone participates in the communities and organizations I hold so dear.

A true leader recognizes the strength of the individual, as well as that of the group, and helps bring those individuals’ ideas to the table. That way, I really do have all the facts, and are able to lead the charge in directions that work for everyone.

I am forced to make critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality in a process of rapid-fire rational stimulus response.
    2. THE PATH LESS TRAVELED - Sometimes my instantaneous observation and action is just what’s required, as in some corporate environments, and especially in emergencies. With perhaps the most perceptive, unfiltered view of anyone, I have a unique skill in noticing small changes. Whether a shift in facial expression, a new clothing style, or a broken habit, I pick up on hidden thoughts and motives where most would be lucky to pick up anything specific at all.

    epithet: "Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Perceiving",
    description: `Although they may seem quiet or unassuming, Mediators (INFPs) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity – Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them.
Idealistic and empathetic, Mediators long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to help others. But because this personality type makes up such a small portion of the population, Mediators may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique.

    ],
    relationshipStrengths: [
      "EMPATHETIC – Mediators don’t just care about other people in an abstract sense. These personalities can actually feel another person’s emotions, from joy and elation to sorrow and regret. Because of this sensitivity, Mediators tend to be thoughtful and kindhearted, and they hate the idea of hurting anyone, even unintentionally.",
      "GENEROUS – Mediators rarely enjoy succeeding at other people’s expense. They feel called to share the good things in their lives, give credit where it’s due, and uplift the people around them. These personalities want to contribute to a world where every voice is heard and no one’s needs go unmet.",
      "OPEN-MINDED – Tolerant and accepting, Mediators try not to judge anyone else’s beliefs, lifestyles, or decisions. This is a personality type that prefers compassion to fault-finding, and many Mediators feel empathy even for those who have done wrong. Because they’re so accepting, Mediators often become confidants for their friends and loved ones – and occasionally for total strangers.",
      "CREATIVE – Mediators love to see things from unconventional perspectives. Few things give them more pleasure than allowing their minds to wander through all sorts of ideas and possibilities and daydreams. It’s no wonder, then, that many Mediators are drawn to creative pursuits – or that this personality type is well represented among writers and artists.",
      "PASSIONATE – When an idea or movement captures their imagination, Mediators want to give their whole heart to it. People with this personality type may not always be outspoken, but that doesn’t diminish their strong feelings for a cause that speaks to their beliefs and convictions.",
      "IDEALISTIC – Mediators strive to follow their conscience, even when doing the right thing isn’t easy or convenient. They rarely lose sight of their desire to live a meaningful, purpose-filled life – one that helps others and leaves the world a better place.",
    ],
    relationshipWeaknesses: [
      "UNREALISTIC – Nothing in this world is perfect – and that can be a difficult truth for Mediators to accept. People with this personality type can be hopeless romantics, with rose-colored visions of what their lives should be like. This can set Mediators up for disappointment when reality inevitably falls short of their dreams.",
      "SELF-ISOLATING – Mediators long to connect with others, but they don’t always know how. Especially in new environments, Mediators may be reluctant to put themselves out there in ways that would help them make new friends or become involved in a new community. As a result, people with this personality type may sometimes feel lonely or isolated.",
      "UNFOCUSED – Mediators’ imaginative, introspective nature doesn’t always lend itself to productivity. Many Mediators get frustrated by how difficult they find it to buckle down and get things done. The problem isn’t that they are incapable – rather, it’s that they run into problems when they become so caught up in different ideas and ideals that they fail to commit to a course of action.",
      "EMOTIONALLY VULNERABLE – The emotional attunement of these personalities is among their greatest strengths. But unless Mediators establish boundaries, they can be at risk of absorbing other people’s negative moods or attitudes.",
      "DESPERATE TO PLEASE – Conflict tends to be stressful for Mediators, who yearn for harmony and acceptance. When someone dislikes or disapproves of them, these personalities may become fixated on trying to clear the air and change that person’s mind. Unfortunately, Mediators’ desire to please others can drain their energy, eclipsing their inner wisdom and their awareness of their own needs.",
      "SELF-CRITICAL – Mediators believe in their unique potential, and they desperately want to live up to it. But this can cause them to have unrealistic expectations for themselves. When Mediators fail to live up to these visions, they may accuse themselves of being useless or selfish or woefully inadequate. Taken too far, this self-criticism can discourage Mediators, leading them to give up on even their dearest dreams.",

I am compassionate and nonjudgmental, always willing to hear another person’s story. When someone opens up to me or turns to me for comfort, T feel honored to listen and be of help.
    2. IN SEARCH OF A CALLING - Like flowers in the spring, my creativity and idealism can bloom even after the darkest of seasons. Although I know the world will never be perfect, I still care about making it better however I can. This quiet belief in doing the right thing may explain why I so often inspire compassion, kindness, and beauty wherever I go.`,

      "INFORMED – Few personality types are as devoted as Architects to developing rational, correct, and evidence-based opinions. Rather than hunches or half-baked assumptions, they base their conclusions on research and analysis. This gives them the conviction that they need to stand up for their ideas, even in the face of disagreement.",

They can imagine few things more frustrating than allowing arbitrary rules or conventions to stand in the way of their success.",
      "DETERMINED – This personality type is known for being ambitious and goal-oriented. Architects won’t rest until they’ve achieved their own definition of success – which usually entails mastering the subjects and pursuits that matter to them.",
      "CURIOUS – Architects are open to new ideas – as long as those ideas are rational and evidence-based, that is. Skeptical by nature, Architects are especially drawn to offbeat or contrarian points of view. And if the facts prove them wrong, they are generally happy to revise their opinions.",
      "ORIGINAL – Without Architects, the world would be a far less interesting place. This personality type’s rebellious streak is responsible for some of history’s most unconventional ideas and inventions.

      "DISMISSIVE OF EMOTIONS – For Architects, rationality is king. But emotional context often matters more than people with this personality type care to admit. Architects can get impatient with anyone who seems to value feelings more than facts. Unfortunately, ignoring emotion is its own type of bias – one that can cloud Architects’ judgment.",
      "OVERLY CRITICAL – These personalities tend to have a great deal of self-control, particularly when it comes to thoughts and feelings. When the people in their lives fail to match their level of restraint, Architects can appear scathingly critical. But this criticism can be unfair, based on arbitrary standards rather than a full understanding of human nature.",
      "COMBATIVE – Architects hate blindly following anything without understanding why. This includes restrictions and the authority figures who impose them. People with this personality type can get caught up in arguing about useless rules and regulations – but sometimes these battles are distractions from more important matters.",
      "SOCIALLY CLUELESS – Architects’ relentless rationality can lead to frustration in their social lives.

At times, they may underestimate the importance of such irrational values as emotion, compassion, etiquette, and tradition. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as insensitive or unkind, even though their intentions are generally good.",

    relationshipStrengths: [
      "CHARMING – People with the Adventurer personality type are relaxed and warm, and their “live and let live” attitude naturally makes them likable and popular.",
      "SENSITIVE TO OTHERS – Adventurers easily relate to others’ emotions, helping them to establish harmony and good will, and minimize conflict.",
      "IMAGINATIVE – Being so aware of others’ emotions, Adventurer personalities use creativity and insight to craft bold ideas that speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to explain this quality on a resume, this vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help Adventurers in unexpected ways.",
      "PASSIONATE – Beneath Adventurers’ quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When people with this personality type are caught up in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything else in the dust.",
      "CURIOUS – Ideas are well and good, but Adventurers need to see and explore for themselves whether their ideas ring true. Work revolving around the sciences may seem a poor match for their traits, but a boldly artistic and humanistic vision is often exactly what research needs to move forward – if Adventurers are given the freedom they need to do so.",
      "ARTISTIC – Adventurers are able to show their creativity in tangible ways and with stunning beauty. Whether writing a song, painting an emotion, or presenting a statistic in a graph, Adventurers have a way of visualizing things that resonates with their audience.", 
    ],
    relationshipWeaknesses: [
      "FIERCELY INDEPENDENT – Freedom of expression is often Adventurers’ top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression for Adventurer personalities. This can make more rigidly structured academics and work a challenge.",
      "UNPREDICTABLE – Adventurers’ dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in Adventurers’ romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life.",
      "EASILY STRESSED – Adventurers live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.",
      "OVERLY COMPETITIVE – Adventurers can escalate small things into intense competitions, turning down long-term success in their search for glory in the moment, and are unhappy when they lose.",
      "FLUCTUATING SELF-ESTEEM – It’s demanded that skills be quantified, but that’s hard to do with Adventurers’ strengths of sensitivity and artistry. Adventurers’ efforts are often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. Adventurers can start to believe the naysayers without strong support.",
    ],
    successDefinition: `1. LIVING IN HARMONY - Unless I take time for myself, I can end up feeling lost in the tide of everyday life, constantly reacting to external circumstances instead of making my own way. Creative and free-spirited, I march to the beat of my own drum, and it would be easy to assume that I don’t particularly worry what other people think of me. But this isn’t the case – I am  thoughtful and perceptive, able to pick up on people’s unspoken feelings and opinions, and it can upset me if I don’t feel liked, approved of, or appreciated. When faced with criticism, it can be a challenge for me not to get caught up in the heat of the moment. If I encounter harsh or seemingly unfair criticism, I may even lose my temper in spectacular fashion.
    2. THE BEAUTY OF AN OPEN MIND - I want to live in a world where me, and everyone else, have the freedom to live as I see fit, without judgment. I embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. Some people thrive on strict schedules and routines, but not me. I take each day as it comes, doing what feels right to me in the moment. And I make sure to leave plenty of room in their life for the unexpected, with the result that many of my most cherished memories are of spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures, whether by myself or with my loved ones.`,

This personality type makes up a good portion of the overall population, and while Logisticians may not be particularly flashy or attention-seeking, they do more than their share to keep society on a sturdy, stable foundation. In their families and their communities, Logisticians often earn respect for their reliability, their practicality, and their ability to stay grounded and logical, even in the most stressful situations.

    relationshipStrengths: [
      "HONEST AND DIRECT – Integrity is the heart of the Logistician personality type. Emotional manipulation, mind games and reassuring lies all run counter to Logisticians’ preference for managing the reality of the situations they encounter with plain and simple honesty.",
      "STRONG-WILLED AND DUTIFUL – Logisticians embody that integrity in their actions too, working hard and staying focused on their goals. Patient and determined, people with the Logistician personality type meet their obligations, period.",
      "VERY RESPONSIBLE – Logisticians’ word is a promise, and a promise means everything. Logisticians would rather run themselves into the ground with extra days and lost sleep than fail to deliver the results they said they would. Loyalty is a strong sentiment for Logistician personalities, and they fulfill their duties to the people and organizations they’ve committed themselves to.",
      "CALM AND PRACTICAL – None of their promises would mean much if Logisticians lost their tempers and broke down at every sign of hardship – they keep their feet on the ground and make clear, rational decisions. Peoples’ preferences are a factor to consider in this process, and Logisticians work to make the best use of individual qualities, but these decisions are made with effectiveness in mind more so than empathy. The same applies to criticisms, for others and themselves.",
      "CREATE AND ENFORCE ORDER – The primary goal of any Logistician is to be effective in what they’ve chosen to do, and they believe that this is accomplished best when everyone involved knows exactly what is going on and why. Unclear guidelines and people who break established rules undermine this effort, and are rarely tolerated by Logisticians. Structure and rules foster dependability; chaos creates unforeseen setbacks and missed deadlines. ",
      "JACKS-OF-ALL-TRADES – Much like Analyst personality types, Logisticians are proud repositories of knowledge, though the emphasis is more on facts and statistics than concepts and underlying principles. This allows Logisticians to apply themselves to a variety of situations, picking up and applying new data and grasping the details of challenging situations as a matter of course.",
    ],
    relationshipWeaknesses: [
      "STUBBORN – The facts are the facts, and Logisticians tend to resist any new idea that isn’t supported by them. This factual decision-making process also makes it difficult for people with the Logistician personality type to accept that they were wrong about something – but anyone can miss a detail, even them.",
      "INSENSITIVE – While not intentionally harsh, Logisticians often hurt more sensitive types’ feelings by the simple mantra that honesty is the best policy. Logistician personalities may take emotions into consideration, but really only so far as to determine the most effective way to say what needs to be said.",
      "ALWAYS BY THE BOOK – Logisticians believe that things work best with clearly defined rules, but this makes them reluctant to bend those rules or try new things, even when the downside is minimal. Truly unstructured environments leave Logisticians all but paralyzed.",
      "JUDGEMENTAL – Opinions are opinions and facts are facts, and Logisticians are unlikely to respect people who disagree with those facts, or especially those who remain willfully ignorant of them.",
      "OFTEN UNREASONABLY BLAME THEMSELVES – All this can combine to make Logisticians believe they are the only ones who can see projects through reliably. As they load themselves with extra work and responsibilities, turning away good intentions and helpful ideas, Logisticians sooner or later hit a tipping point where they simply can’t deliver. Since they’ve heaped the responsibility on themselves, Logisticians then believe the responsibility for failure is theirs alone to bear.",
    ],
    successDefinition: `1. A LIFE OF INTEGRITY - For me, a lack of structure offers not freedom, but chaos. The core of my self-respect comes from a sense of personal integrity. I believe that there is a right way to proceed in any situation – and that anyone who pretends otherwise is probably trying to bend the rules to suit their own purposes. I have a deep respect for structure and tradition, and I am often drawn to organizations, workplaces, and educational settings that offer clear hierarchies and expectations.
    2. PICKING UP THE SLACK - I may find myself doing other people’s work – and not getting credit for it.  My dedication is an admirable quality, and it drives many of my accomplishments. But it can also become a weakness that other people take advantage of. With my strong work ethic and sense of duty, I may routinely find myself shouldering other people’s responsibilities. Even if I don’t complain about the situation, I can end up exhausted or discouraged if I am constantly expected – or taking it upon myself – to pick up the slack for my colleagues, friends, or loved ones.`,

    nameDescription: "“I wanted to live the life, a different life. I didn’t want to go to the same place every day and see the same people and do the same job. I wanted interesting challenges.” - Harrison Ford",
    epithet: "Introverted Sensing Thinking Perceiving",
    description: `Virtuosos love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, Virtuosos find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.
Virtuosos explore ideas through creating, troubleshooting, trial and error and first-hand experience. They enjoy having other people take an interest in their projects and sometimes don’t even mind them getting into their space. Of course, that’s on the condition that those people don’t interfere with Virtuosos’ principles and freedom, and they’ll need to be open to Virtuosos returning the interest in kind.
Virtuosos enjoy lending a hand and sharing their experience, especially with the people they care about, and it’s a shame they’re so uncommon, making up only about five percent of the population. Virtuoso women are especially rare, and the typical gender roles that society tends to expect can be a poor fit – they’ll often be seen as tomboys from a young age.

      "CREATIVE AND PRACTICAL– Virtuosos are very imaginative when it comes to practical things, mechanics, and crafts. Novel ideas come easily, and they love using their hands to put them into action.",
      "SPONTANEOUS AND RATIONAL – Combining spontaneity with logic, Virtuosos can switch mindsets to fit new situations with little effort, making them flexible and versatile individuals.",
      "KNOW HOW TO PRIORITIZE – This flexibility comes with some unpredictability, but Virtuoso personalities are able to store their spontaneity for a rainy day, releasing their energy just when it’s needed most.",
      "GREAT IN A CRISIS – With all this hands-on creativity and spontaneity, it’s no wonder that Virtuosos are naturals in crisis situations. People with this personality type usually enjoy a little physical risk, and they aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty when the situation calls for it.",

      "STUBBORN – As easily as Virtuosos go with the flow, they can also ignore it entirely, and usually move in another direction with little apology or sensitivity.

      "PRIVATE AND RESERVED – Virtuoso personalities are notoriously difficult to get to know. They are true introverts, keeping their personal matters to themselves, and often just prefer silence to small talk.",
      "EASILY BORED – Virtuosos enjoy novelty, which makes them excellent tinkerers, but much less reliable when it comes to focusing on things long-term. Once something is understood, Virtuosos tend to simply move on to something new and more interesting.",
      "DISLIKE COMMITMENT – Long-term commitments are particularly onerous for Virtuosos. They prefer to take things day-by-day, and the feeling of being locked into something for a long time is downright oppressive. This can be a particular challenge in Virtuosos’ romantic relationships.",
      "RISKY BEHAVIOR – This stubbornness, difficulty with others’ emotions, focus on the moment, and easy boredom can lead to unnecessary and unhelpful boundary-pushing, just for fun. Virtuosos have been known to escalate conflict and danger just to see where it goes, something that can have disastrous consequences for everyone around if they lose control of the situation.",
    ],
    successDefinition: `1. DEFYING THE RULES - I have a particular difficulty in predicting emotions, but this is just a natural extension of my fairness, given how difficult it is to gauge my emotions and motivations. However, my tendency to explore my relationships through my actions rather than through empathy can lead to some very frustrating situations. I struggle with boundaries and guidelines, preferring the freedom to move about and color outside the lines if I need to.
    2.  DARE TO DIFFER - Rather than some sort of vision quest though, I am merely exploring the viability of a new interest when I make these seismic shifts. While my mechanical tendencies can make me appear simple at a glance, I am actually quite enigmatic. Friendly but very private, calm but suddenly spontaneous, extremely curious but unable to stay focused on formal studies, I can be a challenge to predict, even by my friends and loved ones. I can seem very loyal and steady for a while, but I tend to build up a store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking my interests in bold new directions.`,
